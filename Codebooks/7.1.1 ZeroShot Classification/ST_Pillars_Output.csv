The team, comprising researchers from various institutions, will work to uncover biomarkers produced by the body or tumour so that specific therapies can be created to combat the most common type of liver cancer known as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The research programme and the $25 million grant for it were announced in a media briefing on Monday (June 13).

Liver cancer is tricky to tackle compared with other common cancers. Conventional treatments such as chemotherapy are less effective on liver cancer.

Hence, the research aims to bring about biomarker-driven clinical trials that will pave the way for more effective tailored treatments for liver cancer patients, said Professor Pierce Chow, senior consultant at Singapore General Hospital and NCCS' division of surgery and surgical oncology, who is leading the programme.

Earlier this month, the Ministry of Health's National Medical Research Council awarded the $25 million grant to the researchers, who are from NCCS, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's Genome Institute of Singapore and Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore and Duke-NUS Medical School.

In Singapore, liver cancer is the third most common cause of cancer deaths in men and the fifth most common one in women.

It is difficult to diagnose the disease at early stages because the liver is an internal organ and once symptoms emerge, the cancer has already advanced, said Prof Chow.

The chances of the disease recurring are high. After removing the tumour in early-stage patients, there are no available therapies to prevent the tumour from returning.

""This inability to prevent the tumour from coming back even when diagnosed early (and with surgery) is the reason why the survival of patients with early liver cancer is not as good as those with early-stage breast, colorectal or lung cancer,"" noted Prof Chow.

The programme, called Precision Medicine In Liver Cancer Across An Asia-Pacific Network (PLANet 2.0), will involve two clinical studies.

In the first one, at least 30 liver cancer patients will undergo immunotherapy after surgery to reduce the chance of the tumour returning. Immunotherapy is a type of biological therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer better. The treatment is mainly given intravenously and orally.",Care to Heal,0.46386054158210754

Associate Professor Tan Chieh Suai, head and senior consultant at SGH's department of renal medicine, announced this on Tuesday (June 28) and said that in 2020, 7,125 such patients - about three in four - chose to go for a form of dialysis known as haemodialysis, up from 4,270 in 2011.

Haemodialysis involves using a dialysis machine and an artificial kidney to clean the blood of kidney patients.

In order for the blood to be extracted from patients, however, an access point needs to be created in their body.

Prof Tan said the best way of doing this is through the creation of what is known as an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), which involves joining a vein and an artery together and causing blood from the artery to flow through the vein.

This increases blood flow in the vein, allowing blood to be extracted from it, explained Professor Tay Kiang Hiong, head and senior consultant at SGH's department of vascular and interventional radiology, who was also at Tuesday's media briefing.

Traditionally, an AVF would have to be created through a surgical procedure on the patient's arm.

However, about 80 per cent of patients with end-stage kidney failure here choose to put off such procedures for various reasons, including fear of surgery, being unable to accept their diagnosis, and worry about the scars left behind by the procedure, said Prof Tan.

This results in many of them having to be admitted for emergency dialysis using a catheter.

But this increases the risk of patients getting infected, as well as internal bleeding, said Prof Tan, adding that eventually, an AVF has to be created anyway in these patients.

The method piloted by SGH is much less invasive. Known as endovascular AVF (endoAVF), the non-surgical procedure can be done in either of two ways.

A needle is inserted in the vein under the skin and guided into an artery using ultrasound. A specially designed catheter with a clip is later inserted to link the vein and artery.

Alternatively, needles are inserted into the vein and artery, allowing two catheters - both of which have magnets attached - to be inserted as well.

The magnets will be attracted to each other, pulling the artery and vein together. An electrical current is then passed through the catheters, burning a hole between the artery and vein.

The method used depends on several factors, including the size of the patient's veins.",Educate to Empower,0.5666559934616089

4,1357023,New programme to improve standard of emergency care outside of hospital  | The Straits Times,SINGAPORE - Every minute counts and a programme to improve the standard of emergency care a person receives before reaching a hospital has been ...,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-programme-to-improve-standard-of-emergency-care-outside-of-hospital-launched-by-temasek-and-singhealth,21/5/2022 13:01,21/5/2022 10:50,C,Care to Heal,"SINGAPORE - Every minute counts and a programme to improve the standard of emergency care a person receives before reaching a hospital has been launched.

Pre-hospital emergency care (PEC) systems are critical as they provide a sequence of rapid responses during events, such as a stroke or cardiac arrest, before the patient arrives at the hospital.

This can make a big difference to saving lives and ensuring better patient outcomes, especially since many medical emergencies occur outside of the hospital, such as at home or the workplace.

A first in South-east Asia, the three-year programme was jointly launched on Saturday (May 21) by SingHealth and Temasek Foundation, in partnership with the Asian Association for Emergency Medical Services and Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study network (Paros).

The initiative will train 250 participants from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam in skills crucial for the recognition, intervention and treatment of emergency cases before they reach the hospital, Temasek Foundation and SingHealth said in a joint statement.

The programme, which starts on Saturday (May 21) and takes five days, is held online and in person at Singapore General Hospital (SGH). Another three days of training will be held in each partner country.

These participants include national disaster management officials, healthcare officials and workers, ambulance personnel, emergency first responders and leaders of community organisations.

Around 30 of them will be given further training to qualify as master trainers. They will be able to develop expertise in enhancing PEC systems in their countries or institutions at a system level, pegged to international benchmarks, and be equipped to train other professionals and community partners.

Speaking at the launch at SGH on Saturday, Senior Minister of State for Health and Manpower Koh Poh Koon, the guest of honour, said: “Beyond training, the programme will promote collaboration and sharing of international best practices among the partner countries.

“It also provides a platform for partner countries to develop joint initiatives to reduce morbidity and mortality, for research collaboration, and share ideas to strengthen their respective PEC systems.

“Ultimately, these efforts will enhance the PEC research and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) treatment capability in our region.”

For victims of medical emergencies to have the highest chance of survival, there needs to be an optimised system of care. This system is made up of the community, first responders, dispatchers, ambulance services and emergency departments working together to provide critical immediate response.

This is known as a chain of survival, and a strong PEC system is part of this chain.

In Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been working to strengthen this chain and track improvements in overall survivor outcomes.

According to data from the unit for pre-hospital emergency care in MOH, more than 3,400 people suffered cardiac arrest outside the hospital - also known as out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) - in 2020.

In 2011, there were about 1,300 cases.

OHCA cases in Singapore more than doubled in the last decade - from 27 cases per 100,000 people in 2011 to 60 cases every 100,00 people in 2020.",Care to Heal,0.6382467746734619

The 42-year-old, who became a Singapore citizen in 2018, has since made significant contributions to the healthcare sector here.

He said his mentor, a clinician, inspired him to pursue a similar path she had taken - moving to Singapore and learning about healthcare here.

Dr Hairil told The Straits Times: ""Ninety per cent of who I am or what I have achieved is really because of my mentors, and it is really about standing on the shoulders of giants.

""What I am trying to do in my current career is to pay it forward and to try to inspire as many mentees as possible, just like how my mentors did.""

As a senior consultant at Singapore General Hospital's (SGH) department of anaesthesiology, he has been at the forefront of the Covid-19 crisis since it started more than two years ago.

In March 2020, Dr Hairil led a small team of doctors at SGH to develop a transparent and safer booth system for swab tests.

Swab Assurance For Everyone, or SG Safe, is a foldable transparent booth equipped with a pair of level-three biosafety gloves. This procedure makes it easier for healthcare workers to perform high-risk coronavirus swab tests.

The system was also deployed at foreign worker dormitories where large-scale testing was conducted.

Dr Hairil next plans to create the largest database of perioperative and critical care patients, and develop machine-learning models for predicting surgical complications.

Perioperative refers to the three phases of surgery - pre-surgery, during surgery and post-surgery.

Dr Hairil's strong sense of commitment to serving the healthcare sector earned him the Lee Kuan Yew Scholarship this year.

He is one of three people who were awarded the bond-free scholarship at a ceremony at InterContinental Hotel on Thursday (June 2).",Educate to Empower,0.7722154855728149

""It will demand considerable commitment and effort from many stakeholders - not just from the Government,"" he said at the Singapore General Hospital's Lecture and Formal Dinner 2022, which was held at Shangri-La Singapore.

""It calls for a mindset shift and a fundamental reorientation of how our whole system works,"" he added of the overhaul.

As Singapore assesses its healthcare system post-Covid-19, the Government has said that it wants everyone to enrol with a family physician from next year, so that each person has a doctor who is familiar with his healthcare risk factors.

This will nip illnesses in the bud and keep more people healthy and out of the hospital, which is particularly important as Singapore confronts issues related to an ageing population and a possible increase of chronic diseases.

PM Lee said it will also lighten the burden on hospitals, making healthcare expenditure more sustainable, adding that it is ""clearly the right strategic direction to take"".

""(It) will shift decisively from hospital-centric care to a patient-centred preventive care. Focus on healthcare outcomes, starting early while the person is still healthy and tackling illness at its root, before it progresses to the point of needing treatment,"" he said.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) is due to release in the second half of the year a White Paper on what has been called the Healthier SG initiative.

The broad-based major strategy shift was announced earlier this year during the Budget debate, with MOH saying that Singapore needed to now turn its attention to a far more challenging pandemic of longer-term, chronic illnesses.

One of these is diabetes.

Singapore leads the world in diabetes-induced kidney failure, with 5.7 new patients diagnosed with the condition daily and more than 8,500 dialysis patients here.

A greater focus on preventive care would enable hospitals here to focus on complex conditions and emergency cases, while reducing healthcare expenditure, which is already expected to triple in the coming decade to almost $27 billion in 2030, MOH said.",Care to Heal,0.47730016708374023

Speaking at the Singapore General Hospital's Lecture and Formal Dinner 2022, PM Lee paid tribute to the more than 62,000 healthcare workers who bore the brunt of the pandemic.

This came ahead of the Republic lifting most of its Covid-19 restrictions and transitioning to living with the coronavirus on Tuesday.

""They were stretched to the limit but maintained the highest standards,"" PM Lee said at the event held at Shangri-La Singapore. ""They were constantly on the front lines, determined and resilient, even at the start when we understood little of the virus.

He added that doctors, nurses and other volunteers were ""fearless"" in executing their duties in the early days of the pandemic when outbreaks occurred in many migrant worker dormitories.

Healthcare workers were also among the first to brook the wearing of full personal protective equipment for entire days and among the last to cease rostered routine Covid-19 testing.

""These two years have been challenging for them, and such a pace is clearly unsustainable in normal times. So we must continue our efforts across the board - at the institutions, clusters, ministry and also in the community - to prevent fatigue and burnout among our healthcare workers,"" PM Lee said.

In the past two years, many healthcare workers were unable to take leave and worked long hours every day, often redeployed at short notice to new roles.

Studies of healthcare workers showed signs of increased burnout and psychological distress. Resignation rates went up, with 1,500 people quitting in the first half of last year compared with a pre-pandemic annual average of 2,000.

With the coronavirus now abating, staff have begun to be rostered for leave.

Such efforts are being given a $90 million boost to take population health research to the next level.

This helps lay the ground for a healthier population, and comes after the Ministry of Health announced its Healthier SG strategy last month that is aimed at getting people to adopt a healthy lifestyle early to prevent diseases and ill health.

SingHealth, which is working on those new solutions to help improve care in the community, launched its population health research centre at the inaugural Singapore Population Health Symposium 2022 on Friday (April 29). It is called the SingHealth Centre for Population Health Research and Implementation.

Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary, who launched the centre virtually, said in his speech that the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be launching the new $90 million grant under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 Plan.

""With this new grant scheme, we hope to support a larger pool of researchers on innovative population health research as part of our Healthier SG effort, going beyond conventional ways of delivering health promotion, preventive health and services,"" he said.

More details will be shared over the next couple of weeks, he added.

Dr Janil said that while the implementation details on Healthier SG are being worked out, they will need the support of agencies to go further upstream to tackle ill health at the root.

In his speech, he said there are some SingHealth efforts for detection and management of chronic diseases in the community, such as the National Dental Centre Singapore's oral health screening for those above 40 years old and a mobile app called Empower to better manage residents with chronic diseases.

The app delivers personalised nudges and reminders on exercise, taking medication, diet monitoring, and health coaching to those with chronic conditions via their smartwatch.

The pilot started with 1,000 patients with diabetes recruited through SingHealth polyclinics, with plans to roll out the app to those with hypertension and high cholesterol levels subsequently, said Dr Janil.

There is also the frailty screening device, called Screenii, which captures the walking speed of an individual when he walks towards it, hence removing the need for an elaborate setup and trained human assessors.

The principal investigator for the Screenii project, Singapore General Hospital's senior principal physiotherapist, Dr Pua Yong Hao, said that SingHealth has received a grant to develop the device, and may take about two and a half years to commercialise it.

Also plugging into the population health ecosystem is the SingHealth centre's large project on the relatively new concept of life space that will explore how, where and why people travel in order to guide interventions aimed at preventing or delaying disability in seniors, as well as improving their quality of life.

""It will give us interdisciplinary learning points, which will be very valuable to understanding the impact of environmental health and social determinants on lifestyles,"" said Dr Janil.",Innovate to Advance,0.7301253080368042

On April 24, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, speaking at the Singapore General Hospital's lecture and formal dinner, said there is a need to further develop the country's emphasis on public health, following valuable lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Public health refers to the study of how the health of populations can be improved and protected. This is sometimes contrasted to clinical medicine, which is about finding the best way to treat individual patients.

The Ministry of Health also recently announced its Healthier SG strategy, which aims to get family doctors to play a key role in spotting diseases earlier and keep Singaporeans out of hospital as much as possible.

The scheme will also see an emphasis on preventive care and more involvement from various public agencies such as the People's Association and SportSG in promoting healthy lifestyles.

The deans of Duke-NUS Medical School and Nanyang Technological University's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine previously told The Straits Times that they believe the push to strengthen Singapore's emphasis on public health will see the role of clinicians shift in the coming years, including taking on the task of conveying and explaining public health messages.

Professor Thomas Coffman, dean of Duke-NUS Medical School, said: ""While providing therapeutic care to patients will remain the major responsibility of clinicians, understanding and incorporating the contemporary principles of public health and preventive care will take on increasing importance.""

On Wednesday, Prof Chong said: ""Most medical schools are more about 'sick care' rather than healthcare. The focus has always been on understanding disease and treating it... but is that right? I don't think so.""

He added: ""If you want to really start to promote population health, then you have to think beyond patients who are sick, to those who are relatively well, and how you make them more healthy.""

To this end, there is a need for a ""new breed of doctors"" who understand human potential in medicine.

In this context, human potential refers to ensuring that early life factors all align so that a child is born with the very best start that he or she can possibly have.

Among other things, this may involve ensuring a mother-to-be is not only physically and emotionally healthy, but also getting the right nutrition when she conceives - a subject doctors may not have much knowledge of, said Prof Chong.

""Promoting health begins with giving people the best start to life,"" he added.

He highlighted that too many doctors are currently trained to function in a specialised setting, such as a hospital, rather than in a community setting, such as in a general practitioner clinic.

In the community setting, it is crucial to understand that the social determinants of health are probably more critical than other factors, said Prof Chong.

""You (need to) understand patients' family background, what kind of environment they're living in... you can tell them to get more sleep, but if they're working on shifts, they can't put what you say into practice,"" he noted.",Educate to Empower,0.7981476187705994

Internal medicine resident Samuel Koh

""Hi doctor, there is a patient for admission.""

As a medical officer on night float - the practice of returning for night duty on one's day off - we probably hear this at least 15 times a night. Little did I know that this was going to be my first contact with a patient harbouring the novel virus.

When I walked in to see the patient, he was coughing vigorously. I reviewed the epidemiological history and found out that he was from Wuhan.

""Did you go to the seafood market?"" I asked instinctively, as the infamous seafood market was already synonymous with the virus. He denied initially but continued shortly after I probed a second time: ""Actually, I visited the market with my son about three weeks ago.""

The silence that ensued was deafening. Between the patient and myself, I suppose, we both had a gut feeling of what that meant.

There was plenty to do after that. Taking his swabs, keying in my findings, calling the infectious diseases consultant on call, and notifying the Ministry of Health (MOH) - all of which had to be done within one hour of his admission.

The patient's son was outside, gesticulating frantically and coughing - without a mask! He was eager to find out when the swab result would be ready. I handed him a mask and recalled asking, or probably berating, him to go to the emergency department. It was adrenaline that kept me going through the rest of the shift.

At the back of my mind, the uncertainty of the whole situation remained perturbing.

The next day, at about 9pm, while I was again busy in ward 68, my phone buzzed incessantly. After I de-gowned, I saw many messages of support, with some directing me to check my e-mail. It felt almost surreal the moment I read the memo that the patient I had seen yesterday tested positive for the Wuhan virus. From that point on, there was no letting up.

After my week of night float, the whole of ward 68 was full; uncertainty became the new normal.

Internal medicine resident Tan Sye Nee

The moment I touched down at Changi Airport on day three of Chinese New Year, I got a call from my senior asking for volunteers at the isolation ward. I had been home in Malaysia for the holidays. Before leaving home, I had reassured my mum: ""Don't worry, I'm in haematology. I'm very safe.""

In movies, people would want to be the hero and would readily volunteer their services. But when I was asked whether I would risk my life to do this, knowing there was no cure if infected, I hesitated. ""Should I even do this?"" I asked myself.

Then I thought, since I was living alone in Singapore, even if I got infected, there is less risk to others. Many of my medical officer friends were married or living with their parents.

Initially, I did not want to tell my mum because she had been really worried as my brother had just gone to China to be with his wife. I didn't want to add to her worries.

But if I didn't tell her, I wouldn't be able to make up my mind to step up. I eventually called her, and she understood and agreed with my decision.",Educate to Empower,0.8788701295852661

‘We had thought our seniors were overreacting’

Internal medicine resident Tan Sye Nee

The moment I touched down at Changi Airport on day three of Chinese New Year, I got a call from my senior asking for volunteers at the isolation ward.

I had been home in Malaysia for the holidays. Before leaving home, I had reassured my mum: ""Don't worry, I'm in haematology. I'm very safe.""

But if I didn't tell her, I wouldn't be able to make up my mind to step up. I eventually called her, and she understood and agreed with my decision.

When I joined the team in the isolation ward, I wasn't very sure whether or not I would be safe, but the infectious diseases department and our seniors really took great care of us.

The senior consultants would check in with us every single day, to ask how we were doing. When we had to use the full personal protective equipment (PPE), they took great care to ensure that all the steps we took were correct.

After managing the first few imported cases, we thought the worst was over. We were then shocked to diagnose the illness in a local resident who had not travelled and who did not have a clear history of contact with a known case.

Fortunately, our seniors had been very protective and made us wear the full set of PPE throughout. Honestly, we had thought they were overreacting, being kiasu.

But in the light of the newly confirmed patient, who we had thought was of really low risk, we finally understood why they were so cautious. That gave me the assurance that we were working in a safe and well-protected environment.

READ: MY MUMMY LOVES ME MORE! BOOK

""I love my mummy and surely she loves me too?"" the girl wonders time and again. She cannot be sure as her mum has never expressed her love verbally to her.

My Mummy Loves Me More! is a picture book inspired by author Josephyne Ho's childhood. ""In traditional households like the one my siblings and I grew up in, the word 'love' was never uttered nor were we hugged,"" recalls Ho, 52, a senior principal at EtonHouse Pre-School Mountbatten 223.

It took her 30 years to be less angry with her mum and to get to know her better, she says. Her mum was 78 when she died in 2018.

Ho hopes that the book, illustrated by Afiqah M. Suhaimi, will help young readers to love and accept their mothers unconditionally. ""I also hope that parents will say they love their children and hug them as often as they can.""

Ho and Afiqah have also published My Daddy Is The Best! to pay tribute to fathers.

Both titles retail for $14.90 each at Books Kinokuniya and Epigram Bookshop.

LEARN: KIDS CAN BE STROKE HEROES TOO

What is happening to grandpa? When he came home from the hospital, he was not his usual self. Mum explains that he had a stroke and how everyone at home - young and old - can support him in his recovery.

Kids Can Be Stroke Heroes Too, a short animation created by the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI), aims to help children understand the condition better.

""A stroke happens in an instant, but the effects are often long-lasting. It affects not just the patient, but also the whole family,"" says Associate Professor Deidre Anne De Silva, head and senior consultant, Department of Neurology, NNI at Singapore General Hospital Campus.

""It can be particularly difficult for children to see their once active parent or grandparent having difficulty with everyday tasks such as eating, walking and talking.""

She says small actions and encouragement from children in the family can make a big difference to the well-being of a stroke survivor.

For example, slurred speech is a common problem after a stroke. Kids can learn to be patient and listen carefully when a stroke survivor speaks.

19,1347003,$2.4 million fund to kick-start research in regenerative medicine for osteoarthritis patients | The Straits Times,SINGAPORE - Efforts to come up with new treatments for patients suffering from osteoarthritis have been boosted by a $1.2 million donation from ...,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/24-million-fund-to-kickstart-research-in-regenerative-medicine-for-osteoarthritis-patients,20/4/2022 15:33,20/4/2022 15:32,I,Innovate to Advance,"SINGAPORE - Efforts to come up with new treatments for patients suffering from osteoarthritis have been boosted by a $1.2 million donation from local biotechnology company StemiGen Therapeutics to the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine).

The Government will match the donation in a contribution to the LKCMedicine Endowment Fund.

The joint disorder affects many elderly people and Singapore has an increasingly ageing population.

Speaking at the signing ceremony for the StemiGen-LKCMedicine Regenerative Medicine Research Fund on Wednesday (April 20), National Healthcare Group deputy chief executive of education and research Benjamin Seet said the fund will support research in stem cell technology and regenerative medicine that focuses on developing therapy methods for patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee.

""Despite (osteoarthritis) being a highly prevalent disease that affects up to 80 per cent of people aged 65 years and older, as well as a leading cause of physical disability in the elderly, there is currently no effective treatment to stop progression of osteoarthritis,"" he said.

Current methods to treat the disease comprise symptomatic pain relief, steroid injections to reduce inflammation, and knee surgery, said Professor Seet.

""With Singapore's rapidly ageing population, osteoarthritis has also become a major cause of morbidity and disability here,"" said Prof Seet.

For example, osteoarthritis patients make up around 90 per cent of the 1,800 knee replacement operations performed every year at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).

According to Dr Lee Kong Hwee, a consultant at the SGH department of orthopaedic surgery, the joint disorder affects around 10 per cent of the population - around 500,000 people. And while many are elderly individuals, there is a growing prevalence of the disease among younger patients.

StemiGen chief executive James Hsieh said the fund will also help support the training of qualified regenerative medicine scientists and practitioners.

He added: ""Stem cell therapy has tremendous potential to revolutionise healthcare in Singapore. Over the past two decades, an ageing population has brought about challenges, including chronic conditions and other diseases that current treatments are unable to cure.

""(The) creation of the StemiGen-LKCMedicine Regenerative Medicine Research Fund will be a first step to develop the know-how and technologies to manufacture and administer stem cell therapies safely, effectively and affordably.""

Prof Seet identified two projects that will be beneficiaries of the fund.

One project aims to develop a 3D-printed, stem cell-loaded bone graft, while the other is seeking to develop medicine that could help osteoarthritis patients regenerate the cartilage around their joints.",Innovate to Advance,0.7572835087776184

Speaking at the signing ceremony for the StemiGen-LKCMedicine Regenerative Medicine Research Fund on Wednesday (April 20), National Healthcare Group deputy chief executive of education and research Benjamin Seet said the fund will support research in stem cell technology and regenerative medicine that focuses on developing therapy methods for patients suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee.

""Despite (osteoarthritis) being a highly prevalent disease that affects up to 80 per cent of people aged 65 years and older, as well as a leading cause of physical disability in the elderly, there is currently no effective treatment to stop progression of osteoarthritis,"" he said.

Current methods to treat the disease comprise symptomatic pain relief, steroid injections to reduce inflammation, and knee surgery, said Professor Seet.

""With Singapore's rapidly ageing population, osteoarthritis has also become a major cause of morbidity and disability here,"" said Prof Seet.

For example, osteoarthritis patients make up around 90 per cent of the 1,800 knee replacement operations performed every year at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).

According to Dr Lee Kong Hwee, a consultant at the SGH department of orthopaedic surgery, the joint disorder affects around 10 per cent of the population - around 500,000 people. And while many are elderly individuals, there is a growing prevalence of the disease among younger patients.

StemiGen chief executive James Hsieh said the fund will also help support the training of qualified regenerative medicine scientists and practitioners.

He added: ""Stem cell therapy has tremendous potential to revolutionise healthcare in Singapore. Over the past two decades, an ageing population has brought about challenges, including chronic conditions and other diseases that current treatments are unable to cure.

""(The) creation of the StemiGen-LKCMedicine Regenerative Medicine Research Fund will be a first step to develop the know-how and technologies to manufacture and administer stem cell therapies safely, effectively and affordably.""

Prof Seet identified two projects that will be beneficiaries of the fund.

One project aims to develop a 3D-printed, stem cell-loaded bone graft, while the other is seeking to develop medicine that could help osteoarthritis patients regenerate the cartilage around their joints.",Innovate to Advance,0.7572835087776184

These include upholding Singapore's standards of medical excellence and further developing its expertise in public health.

He was speaking at the Singapore General Hospital's (SGH) Lecture and Formal Dinner 2022, which was held at Shangri-La Singapore.

Addressing about 300 guests on site, as well as about another 1,000 gathered online, PM Lee cited a study in The Lancet which found that higher levels of trust in the government and among the population were associated with greater compliance with Covid-19 restrictions and higher vaccination rates.

""In fact, by this measure, trust levels mattered much more even than the quality of healthcare and access to universal healthcare.

I do not believe this means a good healthcare system makes no difference – it is absolutely necessary. But it does show how crucial trust levels in the society are to public health and healthcare outcomes,"" he said, adding that Singapore is fortunate to be a high-trust society.

He said that the strong public trust built up over the decades between Singaporeans and the Government, and in one another, sets the Republic apart from many other countries.

This involves trust that the Government has the best interest of Singapore and Singaporeans at heart, that the Government is competent and will make the right decisions on behalf of Singaporeans, and that every citizen will play their part - not just for themselves and their loved ones, but for others as well.

""This trust is a most precious resource. It is the fundamental reason why Singaporeans were able to come together during the pandemic, instead of working against each other,"" said PM Lee.

He cited four examples of this: People here abiding by ""burdensome"" safe management measures, patiently enduring repeated rounds of easing and tightening, going for vaccinations and booster jabs, and exercising personal and social responsibility.

""In other countries, a precaution as simple and essential as wearing a mask became a heated point of contention between citizens... Fortunately, in Singapore the opposite happened,"" he noted.

3 key thrusts of trust: Competency, commitment, transparency

PM Lee said that a big part of this was due to the public's trust in the healthcare system here, which in turn was based on three things.

First, trust that healthcare workers here are professional, and know their job well.

Second, that they are dedicated and selfless, committed to the care, treatment and well-being of their patients.

Third, that the healthcare system is open and honest with the public, even when things fail to go as intended.

For instance, said PM Lee, during the vaccination campaign, the Health Ministry regularly reported statistics on serious adverse events.

He said: ""Some may be tempted to think that it would have been easier to keep things quiet, and avoid causing unnecessary alarm with bad news. It would have been expedient and convenient, but it would have been very unwise.

""If we kept quiet, it might work once, or twice. But rumours will spread, people will gradually lose faith in the system, and we will eventually pay a high price - the loss of public trust.

One of the first projects for the supercomputer will be to help design an algorithm analysing clinical data and heart and retinal scans for heart patients, so that the most urgent cases can be prioritised for emergency treatment. The machine is being developed by the National Supercomputing Centre (NSCC) and SingHealth.

While it will be located at the healthcare cluster's Singapore General Hospital campus, it will be open to all healthcare institutions to use.

Agreements were signed between NSCC, SingHealth and American chipmaker Nvidia for the supercomputer on Tuesday (March 1) at the Supercomputing Asia 2022 event at Suntec convention centre.

Under the agreements, Nvidia will provide access to its software tools and artificial intelligence (AI) models for healthcare research.

The supercomputer is expected to take the AI used by clinicians to make sense of diseases and escalate it. Where standard computers might take days to train the AI using a set of patient data, the supercomputer could do it in hours.

Mr Bernard Tan, NSCC's director for strategy, planning and engagement, said: ""We expect the supercomputer to be up to 100 times the speed of a standard computer.""

Having the supercomputer in-house also saves time as data does not have to be sent to a third-party high-performance computer to be analysed, a process that could take hours to days. To protect patients' privacy, their data will be anonymised so no names and NRIC numbers will be associated with the information.

Beyond healthcare, supercomputers like those from NSCC have been used here in other research areas, including climate change, weather monitoring, urban planning and materials research.

The new supercomputer will also be used to train the AI tool used in Apollo, a national AI project to analyse scans of heart arteries to determine if a patient has cardiovascular disease.

While a radiologist could take several hours to interpret a scan, an analysis could be completed using Apollo in 10 minutes. This would free up time for clinicians to focus on other important work such as caring for patients.

Apollo is a collaboration between SingHealth's National Heart Centre Singapore; Duke-NUS Medical School; the Agency for Science, Technology and Research; National University Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

The supercomputer can also train other AI models, such as the one being used for a project to identify ""neoantigens"" - new proteins with mutations found on cancer cells.

By figuring out what these proteins are, researchers can develop vaccines to stimulate the production of antibodies that can target them and kill the cancer cells.

Such precise targeting reduces the side effects of the cancer therapy, unlike conventional cancer treatments that are less precise and may harm non-cancerous cells.",Care to Heal,0.7310295701026917

The agony was so bad that when she was in her late 20s, there were two consecutive months she blacked out when her period came. On the second occasion, she broke out in cold sweat, blacked out, woke up feeling afraid and made a trip to the emergency department of a hospital.

""I was put on drips, given painkillers and again sent home. No one told me why I was having so much pain,"" the 39-year-old MP for Nee Soon GRC said in a virtual media briefing on Wednesday (March 2), a day before the start of Endometriosis Awareness Week.

She later discovered that she suffered from endometriosis, a chronic condition where tissues resembling the lining of the womb grow in other organs such as the ovaries, bowels and even the lungs and nose.

This may result in pain in various parts of the body, including while urinating and during sex, and increased menstrual discomfort.

Ms Tan's condition is common here, where about one in 10 females in child-bearing years suffer from it. Endometriosis is a disorder that is dependent on the female hormone estrogen, hence, the condition tends to regress after menopause. Estrogen levels decline during menopause.

Dr Ma Li, a consultant in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at the National University Hospital (NUH), said: “Endometriosis is a systematic disease that can affect the whole body and other organs including uterus, ovaries, vagina and rectum. Early treatment will help these women with their overall and reproductive health.”

Some 30 per cent to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis encounter challenges conceiving, said Dr Celene Hui, a consultant in the minimally invasive surgery unit, division of obstetrics and gynaecology at KK Women's and Children's Hospital.

Endometriosis can result in inflammation and scarring, damaged fallopian tubes, impaired embryo implantation, poorer egg quality and decreased egg supply or ovarian reserve, she added.

These painful periods can also result in emotional distress, affecting work and quality of life.

""Most of the time, women of the reproductive age group attend our clinics because they are trying to start a family. The child-bearing potential declines significantly with increasing age. I urge women with symptoms of endometriosis to come forward earlier, so that their pain can be better managed and their fertility may be preserved and protected,"" Dr Hui said.

There is currently no non-invasive, reliable method for diagnosing endometriosis, so the condition's true prevalence is unknown. Although surgery still remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, there is a shift towards diagnosing endometriosis based on symptoms and investigations, allowing doctors to start treatment earlier rather than later.

Dr Hui added that there is a 6.7 year delay between symptom onset and diagnosis, as the lack of awareness of this condition, stigma around menstruation and lack of specific symptoms increase the difficulty of diagnosis.

This condition is more common among Asians compared with Caucasians, and more prevalent among women with a lower body mass index. Those with a short menstrual cycle length or experience obstruction of menstrual flow are also likely to experience higher risk.

To help women diagnose this condition, an online questionnaire that is available in four languages can be done.

""The higher the score, the more they should see a doctor to seek advice. We are still in a society where everybody thinks it is normal to have some menstrual pain. But when the pain becomes so severe that it's affecting your job, your quality of life, it can't be normal any more,"" Dr Anthony Siow, medical director at ASC Clinic for Women in Gleneagles Medical Centre, said.",Educate to Empower,0.8048962354660034

Launched on Tuesday (March 8), the Cardiovascular Systems Imaging and Artificial Intelligence (CVS.AI) lab is the first of its kind to be set up by a healthcare provider in Singapore and South-east Asia, said NHCS.

The use of AI in detecting and monitoring the progression of heart disease could allow for early intervention and counter the world's top killer disease, which takes about 17.9 million lives each year.

In Singapore, one-third of all deaths are due to cardiovascular disease - with 19 people dying from heart diseases or stroke each day.

NHCS, which sees more than 120,000 outpatients a year, performed nearly 17,000 cardiac scans last year alone.

These are images of the heart and blood vessels taken using methods such as magnetic resonance imaging, computerised tomography and nuclear imaging methods.

The structure and function of the heart and its arteries can be analysed from these scans, such as by detecting plaque on artery walls or heart muscle damage due to blocked blood supply.

""AI can potentially capture and make sense of complex information in a multidimensional manner that cannot be done by a human interpreter - improving predictive ability and reducing labour and time intensive processes in analysing scan images,"" said Assistant Professor Lohendran Baskaran, clinical lead at CVS.AI and a consultant at NHCS.

Not only can AI analyse the images to a greater level of detail such that it identifies even subtle changes that would escape detection by the human eye, but it also does this in a fraction of the time it takes a radiologist - mere minutes, compared with between two and four hours.

NHCS medical director Terrance Chua said this allows for more precise assessment of patients' risk of heart disease, allowing doctors to prescribe preventive treatments effectively.

""Over time, this can potentially save costs, broaden accessibility of cardiac scans to patients, and improve overall healthcare for our population,"" Professor Chua added.

Prof Baskaran also said that CVS.AI is armed with the technical hardware and software to securely transmit, store and process patient's information.

The lab's technical lead, Associate Professor Zhong Liang - who is also principal investigator of NHRIS - said that its location at the National Heart Research Institute Singapore (NHRIS) at NHCS in the Singapore General Hospital Campus also ""allows for a constant influx of real world data and daily information that can go towards helping the AI algorithms improve"".

The Covid-19 virtual wards at National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) have helped more than 700 patients and saved hospitals more than 5,000 bed days.

Patients under the programme are prompted via chatbots or phone calls to check their vital signs - such as oxygen saturation and temperature - regularly.

A similar initiative under the MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT) called MIC@Home will be launched in the first half of this year for patients with other medical conditions and for those who require post-operative care.

These conditions include diabetes and hypertension, pneumonia, urinary tract infection and chronic infections such as septicaemia, where bacteria enter the bloodstream and cause blood poisoning.

These patients are otherwise stable but need to be hospitalised to manage their medical conditions until they are fit for discharge, said MOH on Wednesday (March 9).

Mr Lai Yi Feng, the project manager for MIC@Home, told The Straits Times on Wednesday that three pilots will be rolled out, at NUH and Alexandra Hospital (NUHS@Home), SGH (SGH@Home) and KTPH (YH Medical Home)

The project will involve 2,000 patients over a period of two years and recruitment will begin in the first half of the year.

Patients must be 21 or older, and must have adequate caregiving support at home if they are not able to take care of themselves, said Mr Lai.

""If the patient is staying alone, they need to be independent, safe and able to take medications reliably. Suitable patients and their families are counselled by hospital teams to introduce the intent and logistics of the programme before commencing,"" he added.

MOH will then review the programme results before scaling it up to a mainstream medical service model to complement inpatient hospital care for suitable patients.

Mobile care teams in the pilot phase will deliver selected inpatient-level services to the patient's homes, including teleconsultation, remote vital signs monitoring, regular visits by doctors, nurses and therapists, as well as intravenous therapy and simple blood tests, said MOH.",Educate to Empower,0.6240181922912598

Sharing patients' data across different settings

To help family physicians to better track their patients' condition and health trends over time, MOH has been developing a National Electronic Health Record which will synchronise information and enable access to patients' data by their care team, across different settings.

Health Minister Ong Ye Kung told Parliament on Wednesday (March 9) that aside from having access to these medical records, family doctors must also be able to share these records with other providers.

""We want to work towards a scenario that no matter where you are receiving care, for example, at GPs or dental clinics, polyclinics, hospitals, specialist clinics, nursing homes, and eldercare centres, the same data could be retrieved to support your care,"" said Mr Ong.

This comes as the Ministry looks to transform primary care - the first line of care in the community - to an even more important pillar of the healthcare system, by integrating primary care providers such as general practitioners into the system. Only three in five Singaporeans currently visit a regular doctor.

With more people accessing this shared data, and to facilitate secure data sharing, new legislation will be put in place over the next few years to govern this - known as the Health Information Bill.

Artificial intelligence for diagnosing dementia

One in 10 local seniors aged 60 and above has dementia.

However, family members or the sufferer are often unaware about the condition until the disease has become more advanced, missing the chance for early intervention.

This is partly due to early symptoms being subtle, and requiring specialised tests, which can only be administered by a trained healthcare professional.

To support the earlier detection of dementia, Project Pensieve, a technology-driven initiative, was launched.

Tapping on local clinical and technology expertise, an inter-agency team is developing a digital drawing test to estimate the risk of dementia automatically using artificial intelligence in just about 10 minutes.

Dr Liew Tau Ming, a psychiatric consultant at the Singapore General Hospital, said that the new digital tool analyses how seniors draw certain shapes and symbols.

""This is based on previous research which has shown that certain drawings, as well as the drawing sequence, can be informative in determining whether a person is at high risk of dementia,"" he added.

The hospital has also tied up with social service agency Montfort Care to help patients living near its two family service centres (FSCs) in Telok Blangah with their medical needs, including having their medicine delivered to the FSCs for greater convenience.

This comes as SGH said in a statement on Wednesday (March 16) that it digitised patients' prescriptions and also enhanced its Medicines Order Service (MOS) on the HealthHub and Health Buddy mobile apps last year.

This means patients can now check in real time the number of days of medication they have left and how much of their prescription they have yet to collect, empowering them to take charge of their health and not be caught in a situation where they run out of medicine, said Ms Lim Ching Hui, a pharmacy practice manager at SGH.

Previously, patients could also view their prescriptions on HealthHub but had to track their medication balance manually.

Ms Lim said it is not uncommon for an elderly patient to lose track of his uncollected medication balance, particularly if he is on multiple medications.

Now, ""the moment patients go into the (MOS) system, they can retrieve the record of the particular prescription they want to refill, check the balance and (order) the quantity of medication they require"", she said.

Since MOS was enhanced last August, between 7,000 and 8,000 patients now use it each month to receive their medications rather than physically collect them at the hospital, said SGH. The majority are patients with chronic ailments such as hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.

SGH estimates that the system can benefit more than 170,000 patients who need not set foot in its pharmacy after seeing their doctors, should there be full adoption.

While the option to order prescription medicine for delivery to one's home is not new, SGH said it has been running a pilot with Montfort Care for the past three months so that its patients can get their medicine delivered to the social service agency's centres near their homes.

The pandemic has helped SGH realise that social service agencies can play a key part in meeting patients' needs, such as overcoming language gaps.

""In the past, patients would have difficulty in calling the hospital (to clarify issues about their medication) due to language barriers and long waiting lines,"" said Ms Lim.

""Community service partners have been in close contact with SGH to give feedback on these issues that patients face, and we have established this collaboration so that the contact of the pharmacist is given to partners to resolve the issue timely.""

Ms Wang Yu Hsuan, director of Montfort Care, said that its service staff are not only fluent in many languages and dialects, but also physically near patients' homes and can render support more directly.

SGH said that it is currently working with other social service agencies to expand this service to other areas in the hospital's vicinity.",Educate to Empower,0.6820600032806396

These are the ecosystems of organisms that live in a person's digestive system, which can comprise various species of bacteria and fungi.

A study, the first of its kind, jointly conducted by researchers from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (Smart), found that individuals with lower levels of the bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in their gut microbiome were at a higher risk of getting diarrhoea after being prescribed with antibiotics.

The F. Prausnitzii bacteria is one of the most abundant strains of bacteria in the human digestive system.

The study, which took place over a four-week period in 2019, involved 30 healthy participants who were prescribed a three-day course of orally administered amoxicillin-clavulanate, known more commonly as Augmentin. The study findings were published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal iScience in January.

Their stool samples were collected and analysed throughout the course of the study. There were significantly lower levels of the F. Prausnitzii bacteria in those who had diarrhoea than in those who did not.

The finding is significant, as the onset of diarrhoea during a course of prescribed antibiotics can lead to patients stopping their medication prematurely and ineffective treatment, according to the study's co-author, Dr Shirin Kalimuddin, a consultant at the SGH department of infectious diseases.

""The problem is very real for patients who are unable to take amoxicillin-clavulanate because it gives them diarrhoea, even though it is an effective and affordable antibiotic for their infection,"" she said.

""Knowing why may help us identify those at risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, and devise treatment strategies in the future to minimise or avoid such adverse effects.""

Dr Shirin said at least one in three patients develops diarrhoea after being prescribed with amoxicillin-clavulanate, used in treating pneumonia, urinary tract infections as well as other skin and soft tissue infections.

As part of the study, the team developed a simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to determine the levels of F. Prausnitzii bacteria in each of the participants.

The PCR test was used to determine the amount of F. Prausnitzii bacteria present in the stool samples collected.",Innovate to Advance,0.8327614665031433

“When she discovered that the cancer had come back and she had not much longer to live, we quickly went to Ireland to see the family. We had two weeks of wonderful time,” said her husband, Dr Goh Hak-Su, 73.

On her last days, he added: “She had the best palliative care from her friends and colleagues at home. She was able to die at home, which she wanted.”

Dr Goh said she was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in November 2019. She underwent surgery and chemotherapy till May 2020.

In August last year, a lump was found in her lung and she had surgery to remove it. In November, it was found that the cancer had spread to other parts of her body.

Prof Goh, who was one of the trailblazers in setting up hospice care and introducing palliative care in Singapore, started out as a volunteer at St Joseph’s Home in 1986.

She helped to set up palliative care services at Singapore General Hospital and National Cancer Centre Singapore in 1999, and was founding president of HCA Hospice Care, the country’s largest home hospice care provider.

In an interview with The Straits Times in 2019, Prof Goh said she recognised a need to improve the quality of life for the terminally ill, and set up hospices and palliative care in Singapore, despite being told that there was no need for such services in the 1980s.

She was born on Nov 21, 1949, in Hong Kong to a family of doctors. She attended medical school St Bartholomew’s Hospital, University of London, where she met her future husband, Dr Goh, in 1969.

Recalling their earlier days in London, Dr Goh, who is a pioneer in colorectal surgery here, said: “We were both young and idealistic. We take up medicine because we want to do what medicine should be, not to make money, but to service people, to help people.”

They married in 1974 and became parents to a daughter and a son. The family moved to Singapore in 1981.

In an interview with The Straits Times in 2019, Prof Goh said she recognised a need to improve the quality of life for the terminally ill, and set up hospices and palliative care in Singapore, despite being told that there was no need for such services in the 1980s.

She was born on Nov 21, 1949, in Hong Kong to a family of doctors. She attended medical school St Bartholomew’s Hospital, University of London, where she met her future husband, Dr Goh, in 1969.

Recalling their earlier days in London, Dr Goh, who is a pioneer in colorectal surgery here, said: “We were both young and idealistic. We take up medicine because we want to do what medicine should be, not to make money, but to service people, to help people.”

They married in 1974 and became parents to a daughter and a son. The family moved to Singapore in 1981.

The son, who is a 44-year-old doctor, currently resides in Dublin, Ireland, with two daughters, aged five and eight.",Innovate to Advance,0.7655889987945557

The machine, developed by medical supply company Digital Life Line, is set to be trialled with two private healthcare providers here - Raffles Medical Group and Fullerton Health - for its scalability, The Straits Times has learnt.

A spokesman for Raffles Medical Group said it is still exploring the feasibility of the project.

Similarly, a spokesman for Fullerton Health Group told ST that it is assessing the viability and deployment of the machine.

One of the machines has already been placed at Fullerton Health's testing centre at Raffles City.

To use the machine, users must first collect a test kit from their healthcare provider and then self-register by scanning their NRIC or passport at the kiosk. They must then scan the unique QR code on their kit for tagging.

Once registered, they can perform their test in front of the machine, by following the steps illustrated on the screen.

The machine's video camera will also record the entire testing process for auditing purposes if needed.

Digital Life Line's managing director and chief executive Eddie Chng told ST that the machine is also suited to supervise those taking a saliva ART, including the Pasport test, which was developed by Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore General Hospital and other institutions here.

The Pasport test is said to have a sensitivity rate of 97 per cent - in comparison to the 99.5 per cent of a standard polymerase chain reaction test - as the test has an added amplification step that improves its ability to detect the coronavirus from a saliva sample.

The test kit was licensed to Digital Life Line in December for commercialisation, and the company will be seeking approval with the Health Sciences Authority for use here.

Her approach exemplified what she had always championed and done – to help the dying live out their days as comfortably and with as much dignity as possible.

“When she discovered that the cancer had come back and she had not much longer to live, we quickly went to Ireland to see the family. We had two weeks of wonderful time,” said her husband, Dr Goh Hak-Su, 73.

On her last days, he added: “She had the best palliative care from her friends and colleagues at home. She was able to die at home, which she wanted.”

Dr Goh said she was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in November 2019. She underwent surgery and chemotherapy till May 2020.

In August last year, a lump was found in her lung and she had surgery to remove it. In November, it was found that the cancer had spread to other parts of her body.

Known as the SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute of Medical Simulation (Sims) i3 Hub, the facility in Academia, in College Road, opened on Tuesday (Jan 18). It houses a wide range of extended-reality solutions – immersive technologies that can merge the physical and virtual worlds – and gaming equipment to facilitate learning.

Professor Chan Choong Meng, the group chief education officer of SingHealth, said on Tuesday: ""A key benefit of incorporating serious games in healthcare training is the ability to simulate challenging scenarios for learners to practise critical thinking, decision-making and hone practical skills in a safe learning environment.""

Senior Minister of State for Health Koh Poh Koon said in his opening remarks that the incorporation of serious games in teaching enhances ""the breadth of healthcare simulation capabilities"", thereby offering more engaging and interactive learning opportunities which empower healthcare professionals to take increased ownership of their learning.

He noted that the Sims hub has developed 18 serious games that cover a wide variety of skills and knowledge across various healthcare professions.

Professor Fatimah Lateef, co-director of the SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute, said that the hub is currently open to healthcare professionals from KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital, Singapore General Hospital and Changi General Hospital, all run by SingHealth.

She added that the games fulfil unmet training needs among healthcare professionals.

One game, known as the Basic Cardiac Life Support Game, teaches learners to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and identify people who need it. The game allows healthcare professionals to refresh their CPR knowledge and skills remotely.

Developed by SingHealth Alice Lee Institute of Advanced Nursing, the game will be integrated into SingHealth's basic cardiac life support certification training this year. Up to 5,000 healthcare professionals are expected to be trained with this game in a year.

With these games, the duration for in-person, hands-on training is projected to reduce by around 25 per cent, saving on manpower and cost.

Another game, developed by the Singapore General Hospital's department of internal medicine, aims to train healthcare professionals to manage septic shock.

Septic shock is a life-threatening condition usually caused by bacterial infection and can lead to the patient's blood pressure dropping to a dangerously low level.

The game recreates such scenarios through virtual reality for doctors to practise critical decision-making without posing a risk to actual patients.

Examples of other games include one that teaches users how to dispense medicine in the pharmacy properly, one on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) safety and another that allows users to play the role of a decontamination team member responding to a disaster.

Prof Lateef said that games in the pipeline include one on paediatric crisis management catered to non-paediatricians, and one aimed at teaching nurses to deliver fluids, nutrients and medications via an infusion pump.

To support the proliferation of serious games in healthcare education, Sims has collaborated with game developer Serious Games Asia to create a one-stop integrated platform that can host serious games for up to 5,000 players at any one time.

Called the Healthcare-Training and Assessment Hosting Platform, the software also collates data across the games in a central repository, which will offer healthcare educators useful insights into learning gaps and also spark new ideas for the development of more games.",Educate to Empower,0.606090247631073

Professor Jenny Low, deputy clinical and scientific director at SingHealth Investigational Medicine Unit (IMU), which is running the trials, told The Straits Times that there is currently no drug to treat dengue specifically.

Instead, treatment focuses on supporting patients and treating the symptoms of dengue, such as fever and pain.

The new experimental drug works by preventing two proteins from the dengue virus - known as NS3 and NS4B - from interacting.

These proteins play a key role in allowing the virus to reproduce, said Prof Low, who is also senior consultant at the Singapore General Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases, on Tuesday (Jan 18).

She added: ""When dengue gets into our blood through an infected mosquito, it will attack our immune cells and start to multiply. So we hope the drug will stop the virus from multiplying, attacking more and more cells, causing damage to various organs… and resulting in complications we see in acute dengue infection.""

Typical symptoms of dengue include fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting and mild bleeding from the nose or gums.

In rare cases, dengue may progress to dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, which can lead to death.

The drug, which has a compound name of JNJ-64281802, was developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and data on how it works was first published in scientific journal Nature on Oct 6 last year.

It is administered orally in liquid form for five days, and is meant to be used as an intervention in the early stages of dengue.

The study, called Deng-I, will see 150 participants who are confirmed to be infected with dengue receiving standard treatment for the virus.

For five days, half of them will be given the new drug, while the other half will be given a placebo. They will be monitored to see how their conditions progress.

Prof Low said that all patients in the study will be reimbursed for their time and will receive the best current standard of care, regardless of whether they are given the placebo or drug.

Participants must be aged 21 to 55, had symptoms appearing no more than 48 hours before they enrol in the trial, and must not be pregnant.
