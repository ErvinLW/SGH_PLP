The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 27, 2021 Friday","During a taxi ride last year, a passenger hurled vulgarities and racially charged slurs at the driver, as he felt the cabby had taken a longer route to his destination.
 Sahayanathan Anthony, now 48, was yesterday sentenced to two weeks and three days' jail after he pleaded guilty to two counts of harassment.
 The Singaporean also admitted to being drunk in a public place and causing annoyance to the cabby, Mr Tan Take Hok, 66.
 Sahayanathan and his wife had boarded the taxi in Toh Guan Road near Jurong East Central at 6.54pm on Oct 30 last year.
 Sahayanathan directed the cabby to take them to Plaza Singapura shopping mall in Orchard Road. While on their way to the mall, Sahayanathan became agitated as he felt the cabby had taken a longer route to their destination.
 He started to verbally abuse the driver.
 State Prosecuting Officer (SPO) M. Mariyappan said Sahayanathan also did not pay the $17.80 fare when the taxi arrived at the mall.
 The SPO added: ""The accused informed the complainant that he was rushing to purchase a handphone inside the mall and would come back later to pay the taxi driver once he was done... The accused and his wife then alighted from the taxi.
 ""The complainant did not agree to the arrangement as he had concerns that the accused might not come back to settle his taxi fare.""
 Mr Tan called the police and also followed the couple into the mall so as not to lose sight of them.
 Police officers arrived at Plaza Singapura around 7.45pm and noticed that Sahayanathan was intoxicated. He was also shouting at Mr Tan.
 The officers had to separate the pair.
 SPO Mariyappan said: ""Whilst the police officers were trying to find out the facts and calm down the accused, (he) kept shouting, 'I want to punch him' and charged towards the complainant.
 ""The accused was stopped by the police officers, who restrained him.""
 In an unrelated incident, the court heard that Sahayanathan had also hurled an obscene word at a Certis Cisco officer at Singapore General Hospital on Feb 28 this year.",The Straits Times (Singapore),26-08-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999970253802478}",en,0.9999970253802478
1,"Jailed for break-in, hurting woman out of jealousy; 27-year-old threatened victim with knife, caused neck fracture and tried to take her to his home
The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 27, 2021 Friday","Angry that the woman he had feelings for could not meet him, Shao Changdong broke into her flat, threatened her with a knife and grabbed her neck so hard that it fractured.
 The 27-year-old Chinese national then tried to take her back to his home but the police arrested him near a 7-Eleven store.
 Shao was sentenced to 41/2 years' jail yesterday after pleading guilty to one charge each of abduction, housebreaking, causing grievous hurt and criminal intimidation. Two similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing.
 The court heard that Shao got to know the victim, a 28-year-old Singaporean woman, when they were renting bedrooms in the same flat in 2016. She moved out in July 2019.
 Shao confessed his feelings to her some time in the middle of last year but he was turned down. The two continued to stay in touch, as Shao owed her money.
 On Sept 5 last year, Shao wanted to send fruits to the woman's house but she was out with her friends.
 Angry and jealous, as he believed her friends included other men, he headed to her house with a foldable knife, two sleeping pills, a white cloth and a bottle containing a mixture of water and cleaning agent. He entered the flat using a key the victim kept at a window sill and forced open her locked bedroom door.
 The victim screamed when she returned home and saw him behind the bedroom door. To stop her screaming, Shao grabbed her neck so tightly that she could not breathe. He then locked the door and covered her face using the cloth with the cleaning agent.
 Shao instructed her to swallow the sleeping pills he brought, but she pretended to comply. He held the knife against her neck, saying: ""If you do not want to see blood, you'd better listen to what I say.""
 He dragged her out of her home and they stopped at a convenience store to buy drinks and cigarettes.
 There, the victim held onto a display shelf as Shao pulled her, causing it to topple. He then carried her out of the store as she flailed about.
 A taxi driver saw the commotion and called the police. When the police approached them, Shao placed the victim in a chokehold, but let go when the officers told him to do so.
 The victim was taken to Singapore General Hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured bone in her neck. She was given 20 days of medical leave.
 Seeking a jail term of between four and six years' jail, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kathy Chu said there was a high degree of premeditation and planning involved.
 Shao, who was unrepresented, said in mitigation that he never intended to hurt the victim. ""I like her and I wouldn't harm her. I only used the knife to intimidate her... the sleeping pills were to help her rest."" For voluntarily causing grievous hurt and housebreaking, Shao could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined or caned for each offence.
 For abduction, he could have been jailed for up to seven years, fined and caned.",The Straits Times (Singapore),26-08-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999957489983977}",en,0.9999957489983977
2,"To fight lymphoma, cancer patient first in Singapore to have T-cells genetically modified outside clinical trials
Today (Singapore) - Online
August 28, 2021 Saturday","SINGAPORE - Cycling enthusiast Sam Tan used to ride up to 100km on weekends and was one of the fittest in his riding group.
That all changed when the building maintenance and renovation contractor was diagnosed in 2017 with lymphoma, a form of blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cells called lymphocytes.
He has an aggressive type of the cancer known as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Despite undergoing many rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which took a heavy toll on his body, the rogue cells in Mr Tan's body kept returning with a vengeance.
He suffered two relapses, one in October 2019 and another in May last year.
When patients no longer respond well to existing cancer treatments, there areÂ often limited options left for them.
Now, a newly approved treatment has offered Mr Tan a lifeline and a possible chance of keeping his aggressive cancer at bay.
He is the first patient in Singapore to have received Kymriah, a new type of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, outside of clinical trials.
There are other types of CAR-T therapy but Kymriah is the first commercial CAR-T therapy in Singapore approved by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) under a new cell, tissue and gene therapy products regulatory framework.
The treatment took place at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) in January this year.
During processing, modified T-cells are grown, washed, formulatedÂ and frozen before they are shipped back for infusion into a patient's body. Photo: Novartis
The novel treatment involves genetically reprogramming Mr Tan's own T-cells to target and kill cancer cells.
Also known as ""fighter cells"", T-cells or T lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cells that help fight against infections and cancer cells.
T-cells and B-cells, the two main types of lymphocytes, work together toÂ respond to antigens or foreign substances in the body.
However, sometimes, T-cells may fail to recognise or eliminate deadly threats in the body.
Mr Tan, now 56 and a father of two daughters aged 19 and 22, said that he underwent the treatment because he hopes to be able to continue to be around ""for as long as I can"" for his family.
HOW IT WORKS
Dr Francesca Lim, consultant with the haematology department at SGH, explained that T-cells fight against infections and cancers by finding proteins, called antigens, on the surface of foreign cells.
Dr Lim is also assistant medical director at the Cell Therapy Facility at HSA.
""Our T-cells have receptors that attach to foreign antigens and help trigger other parts of the immune system to destroy them,"" she said. Â 
""Cancer cells also have unique antigens but if your T-cells do not have the right receptors, they can't attach to the antigens to help destroy the cancer cells.""
In CAR-T therapy, the patient's T-cells are genetically modified to express a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptorÂ on their surfaces, Dr Lim said.
This helps them recognise the specific cancer cell antigens.
Kymriah is now used to treat some patients with certain types of advance blood cancers.
Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis said that it is the first commercially approved CAR-T therapy in Singapore.
SGH is the first Kymriah treatment centre in Southeast Asia to become operational. There are ongoing discussions with National University Hospital for the treatment to be made available there.

Selected groups of patients are eligible for the treatment. They include:
Children and young adults from two to 25 years old who have B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. It is the most common type of childhood leukaemia
Adults with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma such as Mr Tan. These patients are known as relapsed or refractory cases
For these patients, they would have to be those whoÂ have not responded to initial treatment and have received at least two lines of treatment but have also not responded to them.
Dr Lim said: ""A majority of the patients with these cancers will respond to initial conventional treatment. It is the relapsed cases that are challenging to treat.""
For example, around three in 10 patients with large B-cell lymphoma will relapse and the next conventional treatment option they have is to undergo an autologous haematopoieticÂ stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
An autologous HSCT uses a patient's own bone marrow or blood.
""However, not everyone is fit to undergo anÂ autologous HSCT as itÂ involves the use of very high doses chemotherapy and not everyone can have aÂ successful haematopoieticÂ stem cell collection,"" Dr Lim said.
""Some patients relapse after anÂ autologous HSCTÂ and treatmentÂ optionsÂ after thatÂ are limited.""
BATTLING CANCER THREE TIMES
For Mr Tan, fighting cancer thrice in a span of three years felt like an endurance race.
He first noticed a small lump at the lower part of his jaw in 2016 but thought it was not serious since it did not hurt.
He sought treatment the following year when a large lump appeared overnight under his chin. It turned out to be lymphoma.
""As a person who has been healthy my entire life, my heart dropped when I was told I have cancer. I had a lot of questions. One of them was, 'How much time do I have left?'""
Determined not to let dark thoughts overcome him, Mr Tan kept up a brave front.
He told his daughters about the cancer only when the visible hair loss from chemotherapy made it difficult for him to conceal his illness.
From being fit enough to ride up to 100km every week, the side effects from cancer treatments left him winded and unable to even climb 10 steps without panting.
""I used to be one of the fittest in my cycling group. After chemotherapy, I was right at the bottom and am still last in the group, trying to catch up. But I won't give up,"" Mr Tan said.

""A positive mindset is very important for a cancer patient. If your thoughts are always on the darker side, every day will be miserable for you.
""You cannot feel like you are dying. You must fight it,"" he added.
This never-say-die mindset kept Mr Tan going each time the disease returned. He also continued working despite his condition.
VERY HIGH FEVER, HALLUCINATIONS
As part of the CAR-T treatment, T-cells were collected from Mr Tan's blood through a process called leukapheresis.
This is similar to donating platelets where blood is spun through a centrifuge and divided into its parts.
After collection, the cells were sent to the manufacturing facility where they were genetically altered to enable them to identify and attack the cancer.
Dr Lim of SGH said that the modified cancer-fighting CAR-T cells are grown in the laboratory and undergo stringent quality testing before it is channelled back to the patient.
The reprogrammed cells are infused into the patient's bloodstream via a single infusion.
Mr Tan, who was monitored in the hospital after the treatment, experienced side effects. For about five to six days, he had a high fever that went up to 42.6Â°C.
He also had hallucinations and could not sleep properly for several days.
A patient education brochure on Kymriah states that the treatment may cause side effects that are ""severe or life-threatening"".
The most common potential side effects include difficulty breathing, fever, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, chills, dizziness, confusion as well as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.Â 
The side effects result from an inflammatory response that may happen in the body as the CAR-T cells attack the cancerous cells.
Being bedbound for several weeks left Mr Tan with muscle loss but he recovered gradually.
Today, he has resumed cycling with his buddies. His fitness level is nowhere near his pre-cancer days but he is grateful for a new lease of life.

'LIKE HAVING BIONIC CELLS'
Mr Tan said he was ""fortunate"" that his private health insurance covered around 90 per cent of his medical bills. The treatment, including the hospital stay, cost slightly more than half a million dollars.
While recent scans showed that there were no visible enlarged lymph nodes in his body, Mr Tan remains cautiously hopeful that the new treatment will keep the cancer at bay.
""I guess it is like having 'bionic' cells in my body to fight the lymphoma. Of course, I hope that this treatment will be a cure but no one can guarantee that at the moment,"" he said.
When asked if a cure is possible with CAR-T therapy, Dr Lim of SGH said: ""Indeed, that is the hope of (using) CAR-T cells. It is a major advancement in immune-based treatment strategies, where we try to harness and leverage the immune system to find and destroy cancer cells.
""CAR-T therapy is cell therapy, gene therapy and immunotherapy all in one, and this has trulyÂ revolutionised cancer treatment,Â hence the hope of 'cure'.""",Today (Singapore) - Online,28-08-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999973622633453}",en,0.9999973622633453
3,"NDR 2021: Muslim staff in public healthcare sector, including nurses, can wear tudung at work from Nov 1
Today (Singapore) - Online
August 29, 2021 Sunday","SINGAPORE -Â  From Nov 1, Muslim staff working in the public healthcare sector including nurses will be allowed to wear a tudung, or headscarf, at work if they choose to do so, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Sunday (Aug 29) during his National Day Rally.Â 
For now, the tudung will not be allowed for students and other uniformed services, including the Singapore Armed Forces and the Singapore Police Force.
In announcing that public healthcare nurses would soon be allowed to wear the tudung at work, Mr Lee said that before making this decision, the Government had some concerns.
""Patients in hospitals are often anxious and sometimes very ill. So it is important that they see all nurses as the same,"" he said.
""On their part, nurses must feel equally comfortable caring for all patients, regardless of race or religion.
""We don't want a visible distinction in the nurses' attire to make this harder to achieve.""
The ban on the wearing of the tudung in certain uniformed services had long been a contentious issue among the Muslim community, with the Government often reiterating that any changes to the status quo would have to be done gradually.
On Sunday, Mr Lee said that the Government has been observing the situation in Singapore and that ""by and large"", interactions between different races remain comfortable.Â 
He added that not only have non-Muslims become more used to seeing Muslim women wearing headscarves, but Muslim women wearing the tudung are themselves generally ""at ease"" interacting socially with non-Muslim men and women in most settings.
""Specifically in hospitals, some of the non-uniformed staff do wear the tudung, and we saw that their relationship with patients and colleagues was all right.""Â 
'BRING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER, NOT DIVIDE'Â 
Mr Lee said that Singapore's policies on race and religion need to be kept up to date as ""each new generation has its own perspective on racial issues"".
""Therefore, from time to time, we must adjust our policies on race and religion.""Â 
The wearing of a tudung is ""not just a matter for Muslims"", but a national issue, he added.
""The Government fully understands the desire of more Muslim women to wear the tudung.""
However, the GovernmentÂ was ""cautious about how non-Muslims will react"" to seeing more Muslim women wearing the headscarf, and how it could affect relations between the communities.
""Will it be seen as more inclusive, or will it highlight and accentuate differences?""Â 
Mr Lee said that the Muslim community has understood and accepted the Government's stance on the tudung, but they still hope that over time, things can change.
""In 2014, when there was intense discussion on the tudung, I had a closed-door meeting with Muslim leaders,"" Mr Lee said.
""They explained to me why the tudung was important to the communityÂ and what they hoped the Government would allow.Â 
""I told them I understood how strongly they felt, but I also explained the Government's perspective, and the reasons behind our policies.""
During a parliamentary session in March, Mr Faisal Manap, Workers' Party Member of Parliament for Aljunied Group Representation Constituency, had asked the Government to relook its position on the tudung for uniformed services such as nursing.
That same month, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said that nurses who wish to wear a tudung at work would likely be allowed to do so. He added that this had been relayed during a closed-door discussion with senior religious leaders and members of the Religious Rehabilitation Group more than six months before.
In April, Mr Lee then said that he hoped to announce a decision by the end of August on whether to allow Muslim nurses to wear the tudung.
Speaking in Malay, Mr Lee told the Malay community on Sunday that the Government's main concern was to strengthen Singapore's racial harmony, and that any change to the rules should ""bring different communities closer together, and not divide us"".
On not allowing the tudung to be worn by students and personnel in other uniformed services, he saidÂ that there are some ""crucial reasons"" for this.Â 
He elaborated in English that students wear the same uniform ""whether they are rich or poor, regardless of race or religion"".Â 
This, he said, would help emphasise similarities between students and minimise their differences, and thus allow them to bond with each other.Â 
As for uniformed services, he said that they are ""impartial and secular arms of the State"".Â 
Moreover, as they wield armed forceÂ and enforce the laws of Singapore, they should be seen to do so ""without fear or favour"".
""I hope everyone will take this move on the tudung in the right spirit,"" Mr Lee said, adding that the Government was making careful adjustments to keep Singapore's racial and religious harmony in good order.Â 
""We should celebrate what it has achieved - a truly multi-racial, multi-religious nation, where many heartwarming interactions happen every single day.""
The Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement on Sunday that it is revising its uniform policy with effect from Nov 1. This will be applicable to more than 7,000 female Muslim uniformed staff members across the public healthcare sector, including Muslim nurses.
This sector comprises the public healthcare clusters -Â SingHealth, National Healthcare Group and National University Health System -Â as well as the Health Promotion Board, Health Sciences Authority, Vanguard Healthcare and Ministry of Health Holdings.
""The tudung will be an add-on to the uniform. This will be permitted in the revised dress code which the institutions will be issuing,"" MOH said.
The Ministry of Manpower said separately that private sector healthcare employers are ""encouraged to take reference"" from the public healthcare sector, but it will not be compulsory for them to follow suit.
'PART OF OUR IDENTITY'
Muslims working in the public healthcare sector told TODAY that they welcomed this news but they were uncertain if they would wear a tudung due to practical considerations.
They were appreciative that they would be given a choice to do so though.
The Healthcare Services Employees' Union also said it is glad that there is now more flexibility for nurses in the public healthcare setting to have the option to wear a tudung with their uniforms at work.
""By allowing nurses to decide if they wish to wear a tudung, we hope that this will help to lower the barriers for Muslim nurses who are keen to join the healthcare sector but have been holding back due to the current guideline on this,"" the union said in a Facebook post.
Ms Nurli Fadhillah Ab Latiff, a nurse clinician in her early 40s working at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, saw the act of donning a tudung as a ""personal choice"" and Muslims who want to wear it can do so whenever they are ready.
Looking forward to being able to wear the tudung to work come November was Ms Nia Nasyitah Zulkifli, a senior radiographer at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. She said that it is part of her identity as a Muslim woman.
""I believe many (Muslim) women would feel the same way as well. It is part of who we are,"" the 27-year-old said.

Dr Juriyah Yatim, a 51-year-old assistant director for nursing at the Singapore General Hospital, said that being able to wear a tudung at work will allow Muslim healthcare workers to ""strike a balance with their religious aspirations"" and their livelihoods.
She and Ms Nurli both said that they would wait for more details from MOH before deciding if they would wear one themselves.
Due to practical considerations arising from the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, it may be difficult to wear personal protective equipment while wearing a tudung, Dr Juriyah said.
The women all said they were confident that anyone who wears the headscarf will not see their relationships with their patients affected.
Afterall, all healthcare workers in hospital settings wear a name tag anyway and it clearly shows ""who we are, what we are"", Dr Juriyah said.
She also said that there are allied healthcare workers and medical doctors who wear the tudung at work and they have had no issues with their patients. Allied healthcare workers include occupational therapists, physiotherapists and medical social workers.Â Â

In any case, Ms Nurli said that she and her colleagues stand by the Nurse's Pledge and will ""provide care for the sick, regardless of race, religion and status"".
Ms Nia said: ""It's important for patients and the general public to understand that whether a nurse is a hijab-wearer (headscarf-wearer) or not... every healthcare professional is there to help and they are all equally trained.""",Today (Singapore) - Online,29-08-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999960347176887}",en,0.9999960347176887
4,"Kampong Bahru: From KTVs to cafes; Loud music and cigarette smoke have made way for the smells of coffee and freshly baked goods in this up-and-coming hip enclave
The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 29, 2021 Sunday","If you have heard of Kampong Bahru Road - a stretch of 44 commercial shophouses opposite the Singapore General Hospital - you might know its reputation as a once-thriving nightlife hub.
 Early last year, there were 14 karaoke lounges and nightclubs operating in the area - approximately one in three shophouses.
 In the past year, however, the thumping music and cigarette smoke have wafted away, making way for the smells of coffee and baked goods, and the brewing of a hip new enclave on the city fringe.
 The newest kid on the block is The Ice Cream Bar by Malaysian chain The Inside Scoop, set to open next month.
 Co-founder Derrick Wu, 39, says: ""I've had my eye on this area for quite a while, because it's such an eclectic mix of old and new with the shophouses and new buildings nearby.
 ""It's always had a stigma attached because of the karaoke pubs, but recently, I've seen a lot of new cafes pop up and we decided to try it out here.""
 The exodus of KTV lounges may seem yet another pandemic casualty, given how Covid-19 has battered the local nightlife scene. But discussions to phase them out began in 2017.
 An Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) spokesman told The Sunday Times that it has received repeated feedback from residents and property owners in the area ""concerning noise, drunken behaviour of patrons and issues over safety and cleanliness"" from the operations of the nightclubs and karaoke lounges.
 In 2017, the URA informed the 14 units operating as nightclubs or karaoke lounges that future renewals ""may not be supported"". In April last year, these owners were told that the URA would phase out nightlife usage of the premises.
 Since then, owners of seven out of these 14 units have obtained approval to convert their premises to restaurants and cafes. Some are still deciding. For tenants who have bowed out, their demise was hastened by the pandemic.
 Mr Tay Chew Ming, 59, a retired pub owner who ran the now-shuttered Club 62 at 47 Kampong Bahru Road for 14 years, says: ""I didn't really get complaints when I was operating there. Personally, regardless of the lapsing of licences, I shut the pub in September last year simply because of Covid-19.
 I think it's unfair to ask the KTVs to pack up and go like that. I've been a builder for many years and there are ways to mitigate noise through design... The KTVs need somewhere to be, so it's just moving the problem to another place. MR JIMMY SEAH, who has a two-storey shophouse in nearby Spottiswoode Park Road  I've received a lot of inquiries from people who want to set up restaurants, cafes or fitness studios here because this area is cheaper as compared to, say, Amoy Street. The rents there can go as high as $15,000 or $20,000 for a ground floor space. Here, the rent is below $10,000. MR JESMOND LEE, managing director of Everton Estate, who manages the rent and sale of units in the area  ""We couldn't operate and perhaps we could have pivoted to a food and beverage licence, but I'm not in that line of business. It would have been too troublesome.""
 In its place is new bakery Nuage Patisserie & Boulangerie, which had its soft launch in June this year.
 Co-owner Serene Tan, 38, who opened the shop selling French pastries, cakes and bread with two other friends, was drawn to the area's high footfall and mix of old and new.
 ""The demographics here are promising. There are the new condominiums, the Housing Board blocks nearby and the office crowd from the hospital and Health Sciences Authority,"" she says.
 ""There are quite a few cafes here that have survived over the years and there must be a reason for that. It means there's a crowd here.""
 Another big attraction, say new tenants, is the relatively low rent, compared with nearby districts such as Keong Saik Road or Amoy Street in the Chinatown area.
 Mr Pav Khialani, 36, who owns Firepit, a Mediterranean restaurant that opened in April, reveals that his rent is around $7,000 a month.
 He says: ""I need at least 1,600 sq ft for my coffee roaster and giant oven. I found this to be a new, up-and-coming area. It's so well-situated. Keong Saik is so nearby but the rents there are nearly triple. So I pay much less rent here and I get much more space.""
 Mr Sherman Khoo, 32, the owner of Kream & Kensho, a Japanese-inspired cafe that opened in September last year, says the area's reasonable rent persuaded him to open his first cafe there.
 ""The per square foot at places like Keong Saik or Amoy, or even Balestier or Kampong Glam, is a killer. It just doesn't make sense, unless you're already backed by a huge influx of investment,"" he says.
 Mr Jesmond Lee, 39, a real estate agent and managing director of Everton Estate, who manages the rent and sale of units in the area, notes that in the past six months alone, six to eight new tenants have set up shop in Kampong Bahru Road.
 ""In fact, I've received a lot of inquiries from people who want to set up restaurants, cafes or fitness studios here because this area is cheaper as compared to, say, Amoy Street. The rents there can go as high as $15,000 or $20,000 for a ground floor space. Here, the rent is below $10,000.""
 Many long-time Blair Road residents like Ms Linda Locke welcome the change in tenants, citing increased cleanliness. Blair Road is a stretch of residential shophouses adjacent to Kampong Bahru Road.
 ""I was not right next door to a karaoke, but even then the sound travelled. It was quite noisy and filthy. The five-foot way was filled with rubbish and there were people smoking and hostesses outside. It wasn't very pleasant, honestly,"" the 68-year-old children's book author says.
 Mr Nik Chew, a psychologist in his 40s who lives in a shophouse in nearby Spottiswoode Park Road, is the chairman of the Tanjong Pagar Neighbourhood Committee.
 He cites some of the concerns residents had: ""Residents felt the neighbourhood has a lot of heritage features which don't gel well with KTVs. They also generally don't attract the kind of crowd that might be interested in architecture or heritage.""
 Other businesses operating there also note the improved ambience of the area. Gourmet coffee roaster Highlander Coffee's co-founder Cedric Ho, who has been operating a cafe and a showroom selling coffee machines and beans at 49 Kampong Bahru Road for 15 years, says cleaning up puke at his shopfront used to be an ""almost daily affair"" in the morning.
 The 47-year-old says: ""Sometimes, the patrons don't smoke and vomit in front of the pub, they do it at the next-door unit, which is us. So when we come in early the next morning, we will have to clean up vomit and cigarette butts.""
 But not all stakeholders in the area are happy with how events played out, especially in asking the karaokes to leave.
 Mr Jimmy Seah, a 60-year-old with a real estate business and who rents out rooms at his two-storey shophouse in Spottiswoode Park Road, says: ""I think it's unfair to ask the KTVs to pack up and go like that.
 ""I've been a builder for many years and there are ways to mitigate noise through design. I don't think there was a need to prohibit them entirely.
 ""The KTVs need somewhere to be, so it's just moving the problem to another place.""
 Kampong Bahru Business Association chairman William Lau, 65, an urban planner and architect who also owns and leases out two shophouses in Kampong Bahru Road, says: ""The noise complaints from residents have been going on for years. To be fair, some of our tenants were too loud. We tried to implement measures, but the damage was done. Then Covid-19 came and they were shut down so completely. In retrospect, it was devastating for our nightlife tenants.
 ""But the quick kill was like a big fire through the forest. And now new leaves are growing.""
 Indeed, prior to the exit of karaoke pubs, Kampong Bahru has been quietly reforming.
 Along with establishments like Highlander and the bakery Chef Icon, which have operated on that stretch for more than 10 years, Strangers' Reunion - widely regarded as one of the pioneer cafes of the local food scene - opened there in 2012.
 Co-founder Ryan Tan, 36, says: ""For a long time, I was very used to being the only cafe that opened on weekends there. In the past, people came for something specific, they'll get out of the taxi and go into one place.
 ""But now, with more cafes opening up, we see more people who browse the road and the neighbourhood gets a new crowd.""
 The area now also boasts outlets of well-known cafe chains such as Plain Vanilla and Kith Cafe.
 Food and beverage are hardly the only services supplied. There is also a smattering of hair and beauty salons and boutique fitness studios and gyms such as The System Gym and Trident Personal Training. There is even a cat boarding and grooming business.
 Mr Michael Chow, 51, a lawyer who owns two commercial shophouses along the stretch, says: ""This mix of businesses - it's so diverse and interesting, you can see how organic it is. And the community spirit here is strong, it's really like a little kampung with a lot of first-time, independent entrepreneurs in the area helping one another out.""
 The area is also a rich pocket of art, culture and heritage.
 Mr Toh Thiam Wei, 40, founder of Indie Singapore, which organises tours around the conservation area, says the architecture there is unique to Singapore, and that records of the buildings there span from the 1880s to the 1930s.
 ""Because of the long span of time, there are different styles of shophouses there - traditional, Art Deco and so on. It is quite rojak and very Singaporean in that sense.""
 For art lovers, there is Art Porters Gallery in Spottiswoode Park Road, which focuses on exhibiting and selling contemporary art.
 A new, curated concept space dedicated to photography and art called Art Agenda is right next door. Nearby in Neil Road, there is the National University of Singapore's Baba House, a heritage house that showcases the ancestral home of a Peranakan Chinese family and holds regular exhibitions.
 Along Blair Road, the murals of Thai graffiti artist Alex Face's famed character Mardi peek at you. In the surrounding area, three more murals by local artist Yip Yew Chong depict life in old Singapore. The second storey of Mr Seah's shophouse in Spottiswoode Park Road also has the oldest painted facade in Singapore.
 Art Porters Gallery co-founder Guillaume Levy-Lambert, 59, lives at Spottiswoode Park. When asked about the appeal of his neighbourhood, which has seen a rejuvenation of interest from both visitors and businesses alike, he says: ""It's got this extraordinary charm. I think it is possibly the most beautiful part of Singapore.""

5,"2 children among five hurt after car runs up pavement; Eyewitnesses say vehicle was moving fast; 65-year-old driver one of those injured
The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 1, 2021 Wednesday","Five people, including two children, were injured after a car ran up a pavement in River Valley Close on Monday afternoon.
 Police said a four-year-old girl and two women aged 36 and 43, who were all pedestrians, were taken to Singapore General Hospital. The driver, a 65-year-old woman, was also taken to the hospital and is assisting with police investigations.
 The Straits Times understands that a fifth person, another girl, was also taken to hospital by her parents.
 The car had allegedly knocked her into the grass verge by the pavement as it came to a halt, said a domestic helper who witnessed the incident, who gave her name only as Madam Yayuk.
 Eyewitnesses said the car was allegedly going at a fast rate towards the junction with Martin Road, where it drove up onto the pavement, toppling several trees and two lampposts before coming to a stop.
 Madam Yayuk, 49, said the incident occurred metres away from where she was waiting to pick up her employer's child outside Rivergate Condominium.
 The car hit a lamppost with such force that it was dislodged from the ground and shot past her, she said.
 She told The Straits Times: ""I was so scared, it's like my heart stopped.""
 Together with the little girl's helper, she hoisted the child from the ground and returned her to her parents at the condominium.
 She added that the female driver appeared to have broken her arm but was able to walk as she got into an ambulance.
 Shin Min Daily News also reported that the woman had injured her arm, and that several children nearby were scratched by debris from the trees.
 Yesterday, part of the vehicle's bonnet and other debris were still scattered around the pavement, and all that remained of the trees were stumps. Farther down the road, a dozen parents and maids waited for school buses to drop off their children.
 Another domestic helper, Madam Mary Mendoze, 40, who was looking after some children at a playground metres away from the crash, said everyone screamed when the car came crashing past on the pavement.
 She said dozens of parents were waiting to pick up their children where the school buses usually drop them off that day.

7,"S'pore scientists' novel rapid test a boon for vaccine developers
The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 3, 2021 Friday","Scientists in Singapore have optimised a method for a simple, rapid test that will allow vaccine developers to get a more complete picture of how a vaccinated person's immune system responds to the Sars-CoV-2 virus.
 The novel test zeroes in on how T-cells react to the virus that causes Covid-19. T-cells are white blood cells that are often overlooked compared with its more well-known sibling, antibodies.
 Both T-cells and antibodies are jolted awake when viruses enter the body.
 Antibodies are proteins that can bind to viruses and prevent them from infecting cells. But when cells are infected, T-cells step in to help clear the infection in the body.
 Dr Anthony Tanoto Tan, senior research fellow at Duke-NUS Medical School's Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme, said: ""The T-cell responses to Sars-CoV-2 cannot be accurately predicted by just measuring antibody responses. Hence, it is important to measure both to fully evaluate the immune response against the virus.""
 He is the first author of a paper published on Wednesday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.
 Because they are easier to analyse than T-cells, scientists are more inclined to measure antibodies. Dr Tan said the traditional way to analyse T-cells involves isolating white blood cells.
 But this method requires a specialised lab and takes 10 hours of work and 1.5 days to get results.
 To make T-cells more accessible to researchers, Dr Tan and his team validated a method that can analyse T-cells in less than a day, with less than three hours of work.
 The whole blood sample can be processed without isolating the white blood cells.
 Dr Tan added that the faster test is particularly beneficial for vaccinated people who have compromised antibody responses due to existing diseases or medications.
 ""It would be very important to assess the T-cell response in these individuals to understand if the vaccine could provide protective benefits.""
 For vaccine developers - especially those targeting new and more infectious variants - the test can help to assess T-cell responses by new vaccines.
 To optimise the test, Dr Tan and his team used over 200 blood samples from both vaccinated and previously infected people.
 The team added small fragments of the virus' spike protein into the blood samples. In response, the T-cells released chemical signals, which the scientists analysed and measured - to monitor the T-cell quality in each blood sample.
 The researchers discovered and optimised the test method alongside clinicians from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases and Singapore General Hospital.
 Commenting on the test, Associate Professor Sylvie Alonso, from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, noted that since the method in the study includes only two types of cytokines, additional cytokines may need to be included in the test to more accurately evaluate T-cell responses after vaccination or infection.",The Straits Times (Singapore),2-09-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999971636983312}",en,0.9999971636983312
8,"Hawkers in CBD to get income boost with group-buy scheme
The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 5, 2021 Sunday","Hawkers in the Central Business District (CBD) will get a much-needed income boost under a new pilot scheme that aims to channel business to stalls, even as meals are donated to a good cause.
 The Adopt-a-Hawker Centre programme by DBS Bank was launched at Tanjong Pagar Plaza Market and Food Centre yesterday morning, where 600 meals - including nasi lemak and chicken rice - were packed for delivery to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) campus.
 They were distributed to front-line staff at SGH and Outram Community Hospital, as well as workers at an SGH construction site.
 The scheme involves weekly bulk buys sponsored by DBS, and is expected to increase participating stall owners' earnings by at least 10 per cent.
 It will be expanded to other hawker centres in the area in the coming weeks, as these have been hard hit by the thinning CBD office worker crowds amid the nationwide shift to remote working.
 Apart from front-line workers, the food will also go to needy households, migrant workers and other charity groups.
 Mr Muhammad Danial Abdul Karim, who runs Nasi Lemak Singapura, sees it as a win-win arrangement for both hawkers and customers.
 ""Both parties are happy. The one who is buying is charged normal prices, and the one who is selling earns normal prices,"" he said. ""Delivery apps mark up prices, so customers pay more and I earn less.""
 He sells about 60 to 70 packets of nasi lemak daily, although this can drop by more than half during low periods - such as during the phase two (heightened alert) period when strict safe distancing measures were in place.
 Mr Chua Kim Huat, who works at Jin Fa Traditional Hainanese Chicken Rice, said: ""In the afternoon, we used to get the office crowd. But now, that has dropped by half.""
 He hopes the new programme will widen the store's customer base.
 DBS will also help stall owners grow their business presence on social media and other online platforms as part of the scheme.
 The initiative is in line with efforts by the Alliance for Action on Online Ordering for Hawkers to help such businesses go digital.
 ""This is a heritage we are all very proud of,"" said DBS Singapore country head Shee Tse Koon. ""So we want to leverage our huge customer base and our leadership in the digital space, in order to let these hawkers increase their discoverability online.""
 Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Indranee Rajah, who was also at the launch event, spoke of how the new pilot programme will fit into the broader push to channel customers to hawker centres.
 The current restrictions on dining at hawker centres mean that office workers are likely to order takeaways, even after they have returned to the workplace, said Ms Indranee, who is also an MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC.
 ""The group buy will make a lot of sense - if you're working in an office, you can buy for employees, make an order for 100 or 200 and it's delivered,"" she added.",The Straits Times (Singapore),4-09-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.999995932513593}",en,0.999995932513593
9,"Do more to avoid unnecessary trips by the elderly
The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 8, 2021 Wednesday","My 80-year-old father suffers from both heart failure and kidney failure.
 He undergoes peritoneal dialysis every night, a process which takes between 10 and 11 hours.
 He takes a cocktail of medicine to address his ""complex set of medical problems"", as his cardiologist wrote in a report.
 My family and I are grateful to Singapore's medical system and the professionals at Singapore General Hospital for keeping my father going.
 Because of his condition, my father is required to visit the hospital several times every month for various tests, scans and the occasional emergency dialysis, as well as to see doctors to discuss the test results.
 Last week, my father was required to see a consultant at the National Heart Centre Singapore as a follow-up to a heart scan done some time ago.
 In a discussion that took no more than a few minutes, the doctor's advice was that nothing further could be done for him.
 My family members accept the results, but are puzzled that the consultation was not done remotely.
 When I asked the doctor why the results could not be delivered over the phone or via a video call, especially since the test results had already been available for some time, his reply was that first-time consultations were required to be in-person.
 A hospital visit, which can easily take up to several hours, is especially taxing on elderly patients and those with medical complications.
 With the high number of Covid-19 cases, hospitals should deprioritise visits that involve only delivering test results.
 Video-conferencing and telemedicine should become default options for patients, especially the elderly, seriously ill and the immunocompromised.
 During these times, we must adapt to doing what's right and what's safe, instead of sticking to the ""because this is how we do things"" line.

Today (Singapore) - Online
September 8, 2021 Wednesday","SINGAPORE - A 61-year-old man was sentenced to 10 weeks' jail on Wednesday (Sept 8) for assaulting a fellow patron at 115 Bukit Merah View Hawker Centre last year following a dispute between them.
Cho Wai Keong, a Singaporean, pleaded guilty to voluntarily causing hurt to Madam Tan Poh Cheng, also aged 61, who is a coffee stall assistant.
The court heard that the pair were acquaintances and she frequently patronised the hawker centre.
On Sept 6 last year, sometime before 8pm, they were drinking alcohol at different tables. He was with his ex-girlfriend while she was alone.
Cho saw some friends sitting near Mdm Tan and walked over to chat with them. In the midst of their conversation, he noticed Mdm Tan talking loudly at the next table, so he asked her to lower her volume.
They began arguing and scolding each other. When they were done and Cho was about to leave the hawker centre, he punched her once on the side of her face as he went pastÂ her.
Mdm Tan fell forwardÂ and struck her head on the tableÂ while Cho walked away.
Another man at a nearby table and some other acquaintances helped her up and took her home to rest.
The next day, Mdm Tan woke up and went to Singapore General Hospital as she was still experiencing some pain in the head. A CT scan of her brain showed that she had suffered haemorrhages in her head.
She was hospitalised for two days and granted medical leave for about a month, paying S$789 for her treatment through her Central Provident Fund MediSave account.
She also madeÂ a police report at Bukit Merah West Neighbourhood Police Centre, saying that after she hit her head on the table, she turned around and saw Cho running away.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Wee Yang Xi asked for 10 to 14 weeks' jail for Cho, revealing that he was jailed for at least seven years and given at least 12 strokes of the cane in 2003 for robbery with hurt offences.
In 2018, he was convicted of voluntarily causing hurt and jailed for three weeks.
In mitigation, defence counsel Wilson Tan said that Cho had acted ""out of a moment of folly"" and was not able to control himself, though the lawyer acknowledged that this was not an excuse for his client's actions.
Mr Tan also said that Cho is on medical social assistance and is not financially well-off.

14,"First woman to deliver in SGH's Covid-19 isolation ward appeals to all pregnant mums to get vaccinated
Today (Singapore) - Online
September 16, 2021 Thursday","SINGAPORE - She was about nine months into her pregnancy when she discovered that she contracted Covid-19, and bankÂ executive Vanessa Rickard became the first woman to deliver in an isolation ward at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Aug 24.Â 
After the mental anguish that she went through, the 36-year-old Filipina has a strong message for other pregnant women: Get vaccinated.
She was physically separated from her baby for two-and-a-half weeks after birth and could not have family with her during or after labour.
She was not vaccinated at all at the time.
SGH, Singapore's main public hospital, is now seeing a worrying rise in the number of pregnant women who have Covid-19 being admitted to its isolation wards.
It had not seen such patients in all of last year and this year until August, and more than 10 cases have been recorded since. A number of the women needed oxygen support to breathe, and one is now in its intensive care unit.Â 
None of these women were fully vaccinated and ""very few"" were partially vaccinated, the hospital said.
Speaking to reporters in an interview facilitated by SGH on Thursday (Sept 16), Ms Rickard said that she was hesitant to get vaccinated against Covid-19 during her pregnancy.
She got pregnant in December last year and was halfway through her pregnancy when studies emerged in May this year to affirm the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines' safety for pregnant women. These were the vaccines approved for the national voluntary vaccination exercise even then.
""I was weighing the risks involved and I just decided that maybe I'll wait until after I give birth because I wasn't sure as well what the effect would be on my baby,"" Ms Rickard said.
Now, it is clear to her that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the risks. Her doctors at SGH said that the benefits include lowered risk of dangerous complications such as pre-term birth, stillbirth, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage.Â 
Furthermore, babies born to mothers with Covid-19 were more likely to require neonatal care facilities, and studies have shown that pregnant women are more prone to serious illness from the coronavirus, needing intensive care or ventilators to help them breathe in some cases.
For Ms Rickard, who is now a mother of two, the hardest part was being isolated with no family members or visitors, and being anxious and uncertain of what was going to happen to her and her baby. Her older child is two-and-a-half years old.
She was given a choice to be in the same room with her baby boy, but she decided to be separated from him instead as she was still testing positive.Â She only caught glimpses of the baby through video calls facilitated by the nurses.

The day after she gave birth, Ms Rickard found out that her whole family -Â her husband, older son and their domestic workerÂ - also got the infection.
""(The vaccine) might not prevent (pregnant women) from getting the virus, but the benefits of the vaccine definitely outweigh the risks,"" she said.
""Definitely, all pregnant women should get vaccinated as soon as they can.""
She is now waiting until November to get her first jab, because her doctor has advised her to get the vaccine at least three months after recovering from the disease. Her husband and domestic worker are both fully vaccinated.
KKH SEES SIMILAR TREND
SGH said that three babies have been delivered to infected mothers so far, but none of the infants contracted the virus.Â 
The babies have to be tested for Covid-19 twice in the first three days and once before discharge if they were issued a quarantine order.
The babies get even more tests if they stay in the hospital for 14 days or more for various reasons.
Given the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the wider community, the hospital is concerned that pregnant women remain hesitant to take mRNA vaccines despite growing evidence about the safety and effectiveness of vaccination during pregnancy, it said.
KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), the largest hospital specialising in healthcare for women and children in Singapore, separately told TODAY that it has also seen a ""recent increase"" in the number of pregnant women who were infected with Covid-19.
The majority of themÂ were not vaccinated.
Professor Tan Hak Koon, chairman of the division of obstetrics and gynaecology there, said that KKH saw ""about a doubling"" of such cases in five months, from May this year to date.
Although the majority of these pregnant women experienced mild symptoms, a few developed complications and required oxygen support, so they had to be monitored closely at the inpatient wards, to prevent or treat complications such as pneumonia or thrombosis (blood clots), Prof Tan said.
The average length of stay for these pregnant women is about two to three weeks, if unvaccinated, he added.
""What is most worrying is that the majority of the pregnant women infected with Covid-19 in KKH are not vaccinated. Worldwide, there is an increasing number of pregnant women being infected with Covid-19 and dying from it.""
He stressed that pregnant women are at higher risk of severe complications if they are infected with the virus, compared to the non-pregnant population.
They also double the risk of pre-term birth if they have infection symptoms, and their babies may require intensive care, he added.
TODAY has asked the Ministry of Health (MOH) for the number of pregnant women in Singapore who had tested positive for Covid-19 so far.
'ONE DOSE IS BETTER THAN NOTHING'
Doctors at both hospitals said evidence has established that Covid-19 vaccination is safe and protects the mother and baby, with SGH's doctors recommending that all pregnant women should get vaccinated, as long as they are eligible.
Dr Tan Wei Ching, a senior consultant at SGH's department of obstetrics and gynaecology, said that pregnant women can have the vaccination after 12 weeks of pregnancy, as stated in MOH's guidelines.Â 
""We are just being cautious here, because that's when so-called foetal formation is complete. Over in Europe and the United States, they give vaccination at any stage of pregnancy, so any time after four weeks, we encourage them to consider getting vaccinated,"" she said.
She added that it does not matter what stage of pregnancy it is.
""Whether it is 20 weeks, 30 weeks or 37 weeks, one dose is better than nothing. Some protection is better than none.""Â 
Addressing the main reservations pregnant women have about getting vaccinated, Dr Tan said data from the US have shown that the risk of miscarriage in vaccinated patients is not higher than unvaccinated ones.Â 
The same goes for the risk of premature labour and having small, growth-retarded babies as well.
""We will (tell the mothers) that, no, it does not increase the risk of having a miscarriage. In fact, it is Covid itself that would cause more pregnancy-related complications, whether it is miscarriages, pre-term labour, as well as even stillbirth of the baby if the mother gets very sick,"" she added.
Prof Tan of KKH said that the mRNA vaccines have been shown to generate antibody production in pregnant women and these antibodies are transferred passively to the baby before birth.Â 
""As Singapore moves towards being a Covid-resilient nation, we strongly recommend that all pregnant women, or women intending to conceive, to receive the Covid-19 vaccination as well,"" he added.
In a written parliamentary reply on Monday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has received a small number of non-serious ""adverse event"" reports with the Pfizer-BioNTech or Comirnaty vaccine in pregnant women.
These include rash, syncope (fainting), dizziness and one report of Bell's palsy (temporary weakness of the facial muscles).Â 
However, he pointed out that these adverse events are similar to those reported in the general population.
""There is currently no evidence of safety concerns when mRNA vaccines are used in pregnant women, based on real-world clinical data.

15,"Delivering a baby in isolation: The challenges of getting COVID-19 while pregnant
Channel NewsAsia
September 16, 2021 Thursday 8:39 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: It began with a runny nose.
Ms Vanessa Rickard, 36, didn't think much of it because it was like ""a normal cold"" that she had a few months ago. Then came the fatigue, a dry cough and losing her sense of smell.
Ms Rickard tested positive for COVID-19 when she was 37 weeks pregnant, and was admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Aug 17.
She was not vaccinated against the virus.
""I also had the aches and pains of being 37 weeks pregnant. You know, backaches, joint pains, heartburn ... which complicated the whole thing,"" she told reporters in an online interview organised by SGH on Thursday (Sep 16).
""Thankfully I had no comorbidities so my symptoms were not that severe, but I can imagine it would be more difficult for a pregnant woman with, say, asthma or some other illness. I didn't expect my symptoms and admission to last that long though. I guess with lower immunity during pregnancy this was expected,"" she told CNA separately over email.
When Ms Rickard found out she was pregnant in December last year, there were ""not much studies yet on the effects of the vaccine"" on the foetus and pregnant mothers then, so she was hesitant to get vaccinated.
""I weighed the risks involved and just decided that maybe I'll just wait until I give birth then get the vaccination after that. ... Of course I didn't expect to get the virus during my 37th week,"" she said.
A week after being admitted to SGH, she delivered her second child in the isolation ward on Aug 24.
ISOLATION ""HARDEST PART""
The hardest part of battling COVID-19 while pregnant was being isolated, said Ms Rickard.
""There was the mental (hurdle) that I had to go through with no family members, no one could visit, and being anxious and uncertain of what must happen,"" she said.
""I decided to be separated from my baby. It was two-and-a-half weeks that I didn't get to see my baby at all. It was just via FaceTime. It was really hard not seeing my family."" On top of the mental strain, she found out her entire family (her husband, her toddler, and her helper) had also contracted the virus one day after she gave birth. Her husband and helper were vaccinated.
But even though their symptoms, including her toddler's, were mild, it was ""one of the most difficult times and experiences"" she had been through.
After giving birth, it would be another two weeks in isolation before she was discharged, after testing negative for COVID-19. DELIVERING A BABY WHILE COVID-19 POSITIVE
Ms Rickard's stay was made slightly easier with the ""smooth"" delivery process in the isolation ward. She recalled about four to five people assisting with the delivery, and ""everyone knew their roles"".
""I trusted the doctors that they knew what they were doing. They also spoke to me via Zoom that morning talking about the procedure that they were going to do. They did a simulation as well for the whole process. It was all like clockwork; everyone was really prepared,"" she said.
Doctors who helped in Ms Rickard's delivery explained that the simulation run involved several departments.
These included nurses who ensured no one breached safety measures that could lead to transmission of COVID-19, and the IT department which arranged the Zoom meetings with the patients.
This meant ""bringing the labour ward to (Ms Rickard)"", said Dr Tan Wei Ching, senior consultant at the Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology.
""Besides the delivery trolley, there was equipment for the delivery, medications for obstetric emergencies (and) the resuscitator that (we) had to bring. Once the labour started, we had a one-to-one midwifery care, so we parked a nurse and a doctor there all the time to assess our progress.
""We also had a dedicated operating theatre for the (COVID-19 positive) patients, and the theatre was on standby, in case there was any emergency that needed the baby to be delivered by Caesarean section.""
Dr Sridhar Arunachalam, a consultant at the Department of Neonatal & Developmental Medicine, added that isolating the baby from Ms Rickard after delivery also took much coordination.
""(The isolation ward) is a new place for us, so we need to find the ideal location where we can get the oxygen supply ... and to establish all the equipment in this place is also a challenge. But our nurses and other teams helped us, so we had the set-up ready when we received the baby,"" he said.
""The security was also very helpful for the transport of the baby from the isolation ward to the neonatal ICU. We had to move a few storeys down, so they got everything ready for us, including specified lifts, for transferring the baby.""
In fact, Ms Rickard's baby, Kai Cruz, was the first to be born in the hospital's isolation ward. CARING FOR PREGNANT WOMEN WITH COVID-19
Since August, SGH has seen more than 10 cases of COVID-19 positive pregnant women admitted to its isolation ward, up from none in July.
""Almost all of them are unvaccinated, and only very, very few are partially vaccinated. I have yet to see fully vaccinated COVID-19 positive pregnant patients in our hospital at this point,"" said Dr Benjamin Cherng, senior consultant at the Department of Infectious Diseases.
Dr Cherng understands that many pregnant women like Ms Rickard don't get vaccinated because ""it is all about the baby"" and they're worried that they might harm their unborn child.
In email responses to CNA, experts from SGH elaborated that the reasons for not getting vaccinated include fear that their baby may get COVID-19 from the vaccination, and worry that the vaccination might cause miscarriages, fetal malformations, growth restriction, prematurity and stillbirth.
Some unvaccinated mothers also worry about the effects of vaccination as they have allergies and other comorbidities, like cardiac disease, hypertension and diabetes, experts added.
Finally, they worry about the symptoms of vaccination, such as fever and body aches, and how these would affect the baby.
""Decisions are all about risk versus benefit, and some are admittedly easier to make than other decisions. It's actually a careful deliberation by the (Ministry of Health's Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination) ... where there was the recommendation that pregnant patients should receive the vaccination,"" added Dr Cherng.
""This is based on our current knowledge that the vaccines do work, and that they're safe for the mother as well as for the foetus. Certainly the benefits of vaccination right now outweigh the risks of acquiring COVID-19 and its complications.""
Additionally, the Ministry of Health's website states that ""there is no evidence to suggest that the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine may cause harm to pregnant women or their babies"".
The website adds that these mRNA vaccines are ""biologically unlikely to adversely affect breastfed babies"". In fact, the breast milk of vaccinated mothers ""may help to protect their babies from COVID-19 due to antibodies in breast milk"". After all, if a pregnant woman contracts COVID-19, there are greater complexities.
Between non-pregnant and pregnant patients, the latter are at a higher risk of getting ""more severe COVID"", said Dr Cherng.
""When they do develop complications of severe COVID pneumonia, then (we need) to consider the physiology (in) pregnant women, which is certainly different from non-pregnant patients. On top of that, there's the all-important presence of a foetus, which needs to be considered in every treatment decision.""
Pregnant women are already at risk of getting thromboembolism - blood clots in the leg, added Dr Tan. This risk increases if the patient has COVID-19.
""The second thing is that some of these mothers, if they have severe pneumonia from COVID, there's always a consideration that we need to deliver the baby a little bit earlier. And that can result in a baby who's premature, with all the complications of prematurity,"" she said.
Dr Arunachalam added that such complications are greater if the baby is ""extremely premature"", such as 24 to 25 weeks old, while they might lessen if the baby is closer to the term gestation.
""ONE DOSE IS BETTER THAN NOTHING""
The three doctors from SGH concurred that all pregnant women should get vaccinated if they're eligible.
""Anytime after 12 weeks (as that's when foetal formation is complete), we really talk to our patients and encourage them to consider having a vaccination. It doesn't matter at what stage of their pregnancy they are, one dose is better than nothing. Some protection is better than none,"" said Dr Tan.
She added that the risk of miscarriage, premature labour or having small growth-retarded babies is not higher in vaccinated patients.
""In fact, it's COVID-19 itself that will cause more pregnancy-related complications, whether it's miscarriages or late miscarriages like preterm labour, as well as even stillbirth of the baby, if the mother gets very, very sick.""
After going through pregnancy and COVID-19, Ms Rickard now encourages all pregnant women to get vaccinated ""as soon as they can"".
""More studies have come out now and have proven that the benefits outweigh the risks for the mother as well as the baby. It may not prevent you from contracting the virus, but it will definitely help in terms of less severe symptoms or from being hospitalised,"" she told CNA over email.
Come November, three months after recovering from COVID-19, Ms Rickard will finally get her first dose. INITIAL: gy(cy)",Channel NewsAsia,7-010-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999952402205569}",en,0.9999952402205569

Channel NewsAsia
September 17, 2021 Friday 10:20 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong received a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine at the Singapore General Hospital on Friday (Sep 17), almost eight months after completing his second dose.
The Government announced earlier this month that it would start offering booster shots to people who are moderately to severely immunocompromised, as well as people aged 60 and above, and residents of aged care facilities.
In a Facebook post, Mr Lee, 69, encouraged others to take the booster shot if it is offered to them.
""Cases are increasing rapidly. A booster jab will strengthen your protection against COVID-19,"" said Mr Lee.
""If you are offered a booster, please take it. It will reduce your chances of getting seriously ill, or needing ICU care.""
Mr Lee completed his vaccination regimen with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in late January.
The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination has recommended that people aged 60 and above should receive a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine about six to nine months after having completed their primary course of vaccination regimen.
Seniors who completed two doses at least six months ago will receive an SMS with a personalised link to book an appointment for a third dose, said Mr Lee. Seniors are at risk of severe COVID-19 infection and may develop a lower immune response from their two-dose vaccination regimen, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) when making the announcement.
This is coupled with the expected decline of their immunity over time, as many were vaccinated earlier, it added.
As for immunocompromised people, they have a ""blunted immune response"" to vaccination, and are also at a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, MOH said then.
They should receive a third dose of the same mRNA vaccine two months after their second dose, ""as part of their primary course of vaccination to ensure that they start off with an adequate protective immune response to vaccination"", said MOH.
Immunocompromised individuals will be contacted by their doctors, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.
Singapore is also studying the possibility of using non-mRNA vaccines as booster shots and is in talks with suppliers to obtain the vials, Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said on Tuesday.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 17, 2021 Friday","An unvaccinated woman who contracted Covid-19 late in her pregnancy is urging others who are pregnant to get vaccinated, after she had to give birth in an isolation ward.
 When Ms Vanessa Rickard, 36, became pregnant last December, Singapore's national vaccination programme had just begun. Not much was known about the effects of Covid-19 vaccines on pregnant women and their foetuses then.
 When pregnant women were finally able to register for Covid-19 vaccination from June 4, Ms Rickard, a Filipino employment pass holder who works in the banking sector, decided to wait it out for a few more months.
 ""I was weighing the risks involved and decided that maybe I would just wait until I gave birth and then get the vaccination after that, because I wasn't sure what the effect would be on my baby,"" she said yesterday.
 She would come to regret that decision. Despite taking precautions and staying home most of the time, she caught Covid-19 and had symptoms early last month.
 The rest of her household - consisting of her fully vaccinated husband Carlos Cruz, 33, their 2Â½-year-old son and their domestic helper - later tested positive for the virus as well.
 By then, Ms Rickard was 37 weeks into her pregnancy; on average, a typical pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. She was admitted to an isolation ward at Singapore General Hospital (SGH), where she gave birth about a week later.
 The unusual setting meant that her care team needed to bring specialised equipment to her ward, including a cardiotocography machine to monitor contractions and foetal heart rate.
 They also ran a simulation exercise to familiarise themselves with additional procedures, to prevent Covid-19 transmission during the delivery.
 Dr Tan Wei Ching, a senior consultant at SGH's obstetrics and gynaecology department, said the hospital started seeing a steady stream of pregnant patients with Covid-19 in the past month.
 Such cases rose from none in July to more than 10 cases since the beginning of last month, most likely driven by the more infectious Delta variant.
 Like Ms Rickard, many of these patients were not vaccinated as they may have had concerns about the possibility of vaccine-induced foetal abnormalities, Dr Tan said.
 But she noted that studies have shown the vaccines to be safe for patients at any stage of pregnancy.
 ""We encourage our patients to consider having a vaccination, even just one dose. Some protection is better than none,"" she said.
 ""In fact, not getting vaccinated carries an even higher risk for these patients, especially in the later part of pregnancy, because they're at higher risk of severe disease and getting admitted to intensive care.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),16-09-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999985078528227}",en,0.9999985078528227

The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 18, 2021 Saturday","Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong received his Covid-19 booster jab at the Singapore General Hospital yesterday, nearly eight months after completing his two-dose vaccination regimen.
 ""Cases are increasing rapidly. A booster jab will strengthen your protection against Covid-19,"" PM Lee said on Facebook.
 He added that Singapore's expert committee on Covid-19 vaccines has recommended this additional dose for those aged 60 years and older, residents in aged-care homes and immunocompromised individuals.
 ""Seniors who completed two doses at least six months ago will receive an SMS with a personalised link to book an appointment for a third dose,"" he said. ""If you are offered a booster, please take it. It will reduce your chances of getting seriously ill or needing ICU (intensive care unit) care.""
 PM Lee completed his first two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in late January.
 His booster jab comes as Singapore's daily Covid-19 cases are closing in on the 1,000 mark.
 There were 935 new cases yes-terday, including one imported infection. Of the 838 cases in the community, 241 are seniors above 60 years old.
 Singapore's Covid-19 vaccine booster programme began earlier this week, with about 3,200 seniors receiving jabs.
 Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post on Wednesday night that it was an ""encouraging start"", with more than 12,000 seniors having booked an appointment for their booster shots.
 Over the next few days, about 140,000 seniors will receive invitations from the Ministry of Health (MOH) to do the same.
 Mixing of the two mRNA vaccine brands between the first two doses and the booster shot is allowed.

19,"New institute to study plant use for medicinal advances; SingHealth Duke-NUS centre to research local, regional plant biodiversity for novel uses
The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 18, 2021 Saturday","A new research institute was launched here yesterday to drive advancements in the biological, health and pharmacological sciences through the study of plants and natural ecosystems.
 The SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute of Biodiversity Medicine (BD-Med) will study various aspects of local and regional plant biodiversity to identify any potential for novel medicinal and scientific applications.
 For example, studies could look into identifying plant compounds to accelerate drug discovery, or manipulating a plant's biology to enhance its nutritional quality, said Professor Ivy Ng, group chief executive of SingHealth.
 The institute was launched by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat at the SingHealth Duke-NUS Scientific Congress 2021, a two-day virtual event on the theme of revolutionising medicine.
 ""In Singapore, we are in a unique position to explore biodiversity medicine. Our biodiversity is rich, with over 4,000 local flora species and cultivars,"" Mr Heng said.
 ""We also have a long history of imbuing the city with nature. We have carefully nurtured a biophilic city in a garden.""
 BD-Med will focus on three specific research programmes, backed by partnerships with local and regional scientific, innovation and environmental agencies.
 The Herbal Biodiversity and Medicine programme will use new technologies to extract and study plant components that may have the potential to fight common diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.
 The Food Biodiversity and Nutrition programme will look into the concept of food as medicine, or the approach of using food to manage diseases alongside conventional medical treatment. It will also study nutrient-dense and sustainable food alternatives to boost food supply and security.
 The Urban Biodiversity and Wellness programme will study the effects of biodiversity on the living environment as well as its ability to promote wellness, including mental health. It will examine how a plant's biology, appearance, colour and smell affect a person's health, such as in the use of essential oils to treat anxiety and insomnia.
 Professor Teh Bin Tean, who is vice-chair of research for the Oncology Academic Clinical Programme at the SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre, will serve as the new institute's director.
 He said: ""Tapping the wealth of biodiversity in South-east Asia and Singapore, my team and I hope to delve deep into studying the genetic make-up and nutritional and medicinal benefits of local and regional plants to better understand, prevent and fight diseases, and even contribute to environmental and food sustainability.""
 BD-Med's work will also include developing about 12,000 sq m of garden space spread across four hospitals under the SingHealth cluster - Singapore General Hospital, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Changi General Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital - to grow and study various regional plant species.
 These spaces will house herbal gardens and aquaponic systems, and will double as green spaces that can bring respite to patients and staff.
 To commemorate the launch, scientists from BD-Med and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's Genome Institute of Singapore jointly announced that they had successfully sequenced the genome of Singapore's national flower, the Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid.
 Understanding the orchid's genetic make-up could help make the breeding of other orchid hybrids more efficient, Prof Teh said, adding that further research may also uncover potential therapeutic applications for health and wellness.
 ""This study shows the possibilities of harnessing the insights and knowledge from local and regional plant biodiversity studies for applications in science and medicine,"" he said.
 At the event's opening ceremony yesterday, philanthropist Vincent Cheng, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Verdant Foundation, presented BD-Med's leaders with a cheque for $5 million as a gift to support the institute's work.",The Straits Times (Singapore),17-09-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999965817409784}",en,0.9999965817409784
20,"Longer wait for hospital admission as A&E departments see more cases
The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 21, 2021 Tuesday","Some patients requiring admission have had to wait longer for beds, with most emergency departments (EDs) at public hospitals kept busier in the past week compared with the month before, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said yesterday.
 The EDs are also seeing a higher number of Covid-19 cases, with more beds diverted to meet their needs, a spokesman told The Straits Times.
 ""While the hospitals had been scaling back non-urgent surgery and admissions, the overall hospital capacity utilisation is getting more and more tight.""
 According to the latest data available from MOH's website, the median waiting time for admission to wards from EDs was as high as 141/2 hours at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital during the week beginning Sept 5.
 Data for the week beginning Sept 12 is not available yet.
 Hospitals like Singapore General Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) said last week that they are prioritising those who are critically ill, given the large number of patients showing up at their EDs.
 At TTSH yesterday afternoon, The Straits Times saw a large tent being deployed at the carpark next to its ED.
 The hospital said the carpark is partially closed so as to create more screening space as part of its Covid-19 ramped-up efforts.
 Asked if the increased number of patients visiting EDs was worrying, Singapore's director of medical services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, said yesterday that it is likely that many people who are well end up going to the hospital as they are worried and are not sure what to do.
 ""And a lot of people are actually very anxious,"" said Prof Mak, who spoke to ST on the sidelines of the Singaporean Researchers Global Summit at the Nanyang Technological University.
 Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post on Sunday that while the overall intensive care unit (ICU) capacity is holding up, the Singapore healthcare system's accident and emergency (A&E) departments, as well as general wards, are ""coming under pressure"".
 ""Our hospitals and healthcare workers cannot be overburdened. At this point, this is MOH's biggest challenge and we are doing our best to solve this,"" he added.
 This is why younger, fully vaccinated people are being encouraged to recover at home, he wrote.
 Mr Ong noted that more than 98 per cent of those infected from May 1 to last Thursday had either mild symptoms or none, and tended to remain that way until recovery.
 His comments came a day after MOH said that some public hospitals had been experiencing a surge in patients who rushed to A&E departments with mild respiratory infection symptoms.
 MOH also announced on Sunday that a new category of community care facilities will be set up for Covid-19 patients who are generally well but have underlying health conditions that require closer monitoring.
 The move is aimed at augmenting hospital capacity so that only Covid-19 patients who need specialised medical attention or intensive care will be hospitalised.",The Straits Times (Singapore),20-09-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999943615541557}",en,0.9999943615541557
21,"'I was burning': Worker who survived deadly Tuas blast recalls explosion that burnt 58% of his body's surface area
Today (Singapore) - Online
September 21, 2021 Tuesday","SINGAPORE - First, a loud explosion, then the force of a gust of hot air pushed him to the ground in the dark, smoke-filled workshop. ""I realised that I was burning and that my clothes had burnt off, leaving me with only my pants."" He then crawled to an exit to make a run for safety.
One of the survivors of the deadly Tuas industrial explosion on Feb 24, 22-year-old Bangladeshi worker Mehedi, who goes by one name, gave this account as public hearings into the cause and circumstances of the blast that claimed three lives entered their second day on Tuesday (Sept 21).
Of the seven workers who were injured from the blast, Mr Mehedi, the youngest of them, suffered the most extensive burns - covering 58 per cent of his total body surface area, including his face, scalp, limbs and back. After his escape, he lapsed into unconsciousness for three days.
Till today, he still has problems sleeping at night as he often thinks about the accident, he said in his statement read out in the hearing by Deputy Senior State Counsel Sivakumar Ramasamy.
""I sometimes awake in the middle of the night and am unable to fall back asleep. I feel sad... I had a whole future ahead of me before the accident,""Â Mr Mehedi said.
The inquiry committee heard evidence on Tuesday that Mr Mehedi's employer, Mr Chua Xing Da, the sole director at fire protection contractor Stars Engrg, had from Feb 18 doubled the daily targetÂ from 16Â to 32 for the main product made there: Fire-rated insulation wraps.
That increased target came just days after a small fire broke out on Feb 12 last year, at the mixer machine that was used to make fire clay, a key component of the fire wrap.
This wasÂ followed by Mr Mehedi's discovery of a hairline crack on each of the machine's two front bottom corners the day after.
NEW PRODUCTION TARGETS
On the first day of the hearings, the inquiry committee heard that workers, including Mr Mehedi, had alerted their superiors to oil leaks, heater damage, smoke and small fires from as early as August last year.
The issues all related to the mixer machine, which was purchased from Chinese e-commerce retailer Alibaba in 2019 and installed on a platform at the workshop in June last year.
In order to meet Mr Chua's new target, Mr Mehedi said that workers had to work more than 12 hours a day - from about 8am to between 8.30pm and 9.30pmÂ - with only an hour-long lunch break in between.
Another Bangladeshi worker who goes by the name Imam, 34,Â took the stand on Monday andÂ said that he fell out with Mr Chua twice between October and December last year because he could not reach the previous target of 16 wraps a day. He spoke of even longer working hours.
On one of the days, despite having worked from 8am to 3am, a period of 19 hours, Mr Imam said that he and three other workers could only make seven or eight rolls, and had gone to sleep without the job completed.
Mr Chua got angry when he called at 7.30am to check if the 16 rolls were completed, and told him that he was no longer needed at the workshop,Â Mr Imam added.
IMPROPER ATTIRE
The inquiry committee, led by Senior District Judge Ong Hian Sun, also heard that Mr Chua did not set out how workers should be dressed while working at the workshop, located at 32E Tuas Avenue 11, apart from requiring them to put on a respirator and safety shoes.
Mr Mehedi said that Mr Chua would get ""very angry"" whenever he spotted workers not wearing a respirator and safety shoes, but not all workers were givenÂ respirators.
Four new workers who were added to the fire wrap production team at the workshop on Feb 18 due to the increase in workload did not have respirators, Mr Mehedi noted.
The respirators were meant to protect them against the toxic fumes produced during the manufacturing process and ensure that they do not inhale the powdered raw materials used to make the fire clay, which includes boric acid and potato starch powder, he said.
Mr Mehedi also revealed that some of the workers decided to wear slippers despite Mr Chua's reminders.
Mr Mehedi also wore slippers because he felt that the safety shoes were not required when he was assembling the 1.1m-by-5m fire wrap, since there was no danger of heavy objects falling on his feet and he was not handling metals.
He was wearing a respirator, long-sleeve shirt, long pants, slippers, socks and gloves when theÂ blast happened.
THE AFTERMATH
Mr Mehedi recounted that he was the one who put out the smaller fire that broke out at the bottom of the mixer machine at about 8.39am, just hours before the blast happenedÂ at 11.22am. He used a fire extinguisher.
After putting out the small fire, heÂ returned to making fire wraps at his assigned assembly table, while his colleagues - Mr S Marimuthu, 38, from India and Mr Shohel Md, 23, from Bangladesh - handled the situation by fiddling with the mixer machine's heaters.
At some point, he heard the sound of the mixer machine's motor running, which meant that the machine was in the process of mixing, but it stopped again a few seconds later. That was the last time he heard the sound of its motor running, he said.
The explosion occurred about half an hour later.
After crawling out the workshop through its front shutters, Mr MehediÂ stood up and ran outside before turning to the open field at the back of the industrial estate, where he found two other workers who had already made their escape.
""We were in a very bad condition and were shouting for help,"" he said. Workers who were not from the workshop then started throwing and spraying water on them, he added.
Mr Mehedi was later takenÂ to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), where he lost consciousness and awoke three days later inÂ its burns unit and was under intensive care.
Although he was later moved to Outram Community Hospital and then dischargedÂ on April 29, he said that some of his burn areas are still painful and he often experiences a sharp pain atÂ the back of his head.
His skin also gets very itchy and tight, he is unable to raise his arms above his head fullyÂ and he feels tightness whenever he turns his body and head.
The skin on the two areas by the side of his jaw has become hardened, and he has lost strength and mobility in his fingers such that it is difficult for him to open bottles, he said.
His eyes also suffered burns, and he now gets blurry vision on top of them being ""very dry"", he added. Doctors told him his eyes will not return to their original stateÂ and he should wear sunglasses whenever he goes out in the sun.
Mr Mehedi continues to go for follow-up outpatient treatments at the SGH Burns Centre, physiotherapy at Outram Community Hospital and check-ups at the Singapore National Eye Centre.
""I would like to return to Bangladesh to see my family as soon as I can, after completing my treatment,"" he said.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 22, 2021 Wednesday","The first injured worker to testify during an inquiry hearing regarding an explosion in Tuas in February said there had been several incidents involving fires, smoke and oil leaks leading up to the blast that killed three people.
 Mr Mehedi, 22, a Bangladeshi national who goes by one name, told the inquiry committee yesterday that he had even put out a small fire just three hours before the explosion, which occurred at 11.20am on Feb 24.
 Mr Mehedi, the youngest of the 10 injured workers, had burns to his head, face, back, shoulders, arms, hands and one leg.
 He has also lost strength and mobility in his fingers and has blurred vision. Doctors have told him his eyesight will not return to normal.
 Recalling the blast, Mr Mehedi said: ""I felt a gust of hot air pushing me, and I fell to the floor. I looked up and saw that the whole workshop was dark and filled with smoke. I realised that I was burning and that my clothes had burned off, leaving me with only my pants.""
 He said that he crawled out of the workshop and ran to a nearby open field where other workers were shouting for help.
 Mr Mehedi, whose statement was translated from Bengali, was testifying on the second day of public hearings before an inquiry committee looking into the explosion in a ground-floor industrial unit at 32E Tuas Avenue 11.
 Three workers - Mr Subbaiyan Marimuthu, 38, an Indian national, and Mr Anisuzzaman MD, 29, and Mr Shohel MD, 23, both Bangladeshi nationals - died from severe burns to 90 per cent of their bodies. Seven others, including Mr Mehedi, were injured.
 The other workers who were at the unit during the explosion were Mr Hossain Jitu, Mr Molla Md Yousuf, Mr Rahad Asfaquzzaman and Mr Ahmmed Lizon.
 They were employees of Stars Engrg, a company that installed fire protection systems, which included sprinklers, risers and hydrants.
 The company also produced fire wrap, a material used to insulate water pipes and air-conditioning ducting systems against fire.
 A machine was used to mix several ingredients, including potato starch, to make fire clay, which is used to make the fire wrap.
 The machine had nine heaters to heat oil in an oil jacket, a compartment that wrapped the mixer.
 The committee heard on Monday that investigations found that the amount of oil used by Stars Engrg may not have adequately covered the heaters.
 Mr Mehedi's main job at the Tuas workshop was to assemble pieces of fire wrap at assembly tables located below the mixer machine, which was on a platform.
 Yesterday, he listed several incidents leading up to the explosion in which smoke, leaks or fires were observed on or near the mixer machine.
 On Aug 28 last year, Mr Mehedi noticed smoke coming out from one of the heaters of the mixer machine.
 It was not explained to him what happened to the heater, which was later replaced.
 On Sept 28 last year, Mr Mehedi saw that ""a little bit of oil"" was leaking from the oil jacket when the mixer machine was in operation. His co-worker told him that he had informed project engineer Lwin Moe Tun of the leak.
 Two weeks later, Mr Mehedi recalled, there was ""something like smoke or oil"" coming from the same area of the machine, but the leak had grown. His colleague then welded the area to close off the leak.
 On Feb 12 this year, at around 4.50pm, a small fire broke out at the mixer machine's oil jacket while it was mixing the fire clay.
 Mr Marimuthu and Mr Mehedi used a hose to put out the fire.
 Mr Mehedi then noticed black beads of oil dripping down the machine where the fire had been. White smoke was also emanating from that area.
 Mr Mehedi called Mr Chua Xing Da, the sole director of Stars Engrg, and told him about the fire. Mr Chua asked if anyone was injured and instructed everyone to leave the workshop.
 The machine was later welded again, and fire extinguishers were placed in the workshop.
 On the day of the explosion, at about 8.40am, Mr Mehedi was working at an assembly table on the ground floor when he saw fire coming out of one of the mixer machine's heaters. He put out the fire with a fire extinguisher.
 Afterwards, Mr Mehedi told Mr Marimuthu to tell Mr Chua and Mr Lwin Moe Tun about the issue and get instructions on what to do next. He returned to assembling the fire wrap at the table on the ground floor, where he was standing when the blast occurred.
 Following the explosion, Mr Mehedi said that workers in the vicinity sprayed water on him and other injured workers using a hose.
 He was taken to Singapore General Hospital (SGH), where he passed out. He woke up three days later in the intensive care unit of SGH's burns unit.
 Mr Mehedi was discharged on April 29, but continues to receive outpatient treatment for his burns and is undergoing physiotherapy for his fingers. He also visits the Singapore National Eye Centre every two months.
 Doctors did not tell him how long his treatment will take to complete, but they said that his burn scars will not heal completely.
 ""Some of (the burned) areas are still painful, and I often experience a sharp pain at the back of my head,"" said Mr Mehedi.
 He added: ""I am the youngest of all the workers who were injured in the accident, and I had a whole future ahead of me before the accident. I would like to return to Bangladesh to see my family as soon as I can, after completing my treatment.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),21-09-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999982054495896}",en,0.9999982054495896
23,"Switch room explosion at Tuas incineration plant kills 65-year-old worker, injures 2 others
Today (Singapore) - Online
September 23, 2021 Thursday","SINGAPORE - A 65-year-old worker has died and two others have been taken to the hospital with burn injuries after a ""localised explosion"" took place in an electrical switch room at the Tuas Incineration Plant on Thursday (Sept 23).
About 80 people self-evacuated from the premises, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a Facebook post.
SCDF said that it responded to a fire at 20 Tuas Avenue 20 at about 3.15pm and upon arrival, found that an electrical switch room on the first floor was smoke-logged.
Its firefighters, wearing breathing apparatus sets, entered the premises cautiously to locate the fire, which is linked toÂ a chimney fan switch in the electrical switchroom.
Firefighters extinguished a few pockets of fire with two dry powder fire extinguishers.
""SCDF conveyed two persons to the Singapore General Hospital for burn injuries. A person was pronounced dead at the scene by an SCDF paramedic,"" it said.
Patients who suffer smoke inhalation or serious burn injuries but are in stable conditionÂ will be taken to Singapore General Hospital's specialised burn centre instead of the nearest hospital.
SCDF added that it is investigating the cause of the fire.
The police said that they were alerted to the incident at 3.15pm andÂ aÂ 65-year-old man was found lying motionless at the plant. He was pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic.Â 
The two other men, aged 59 and 64, were taken to the hospital.Â 
Police investigations are ongoing.
The National Environment Agency (NEA), which runs the plant, said that technicians were operating the high-tension electrical switch gear for maintenance work when the explosion happened.Â 
It added that operations at the plant have been safely wound down.
""The National Environment Agency is in contact with our officers' family members and providing all assistance possible,"" the agency said, adding that all other workers of the plant are safe.
The Ministry of Manpower said in the statement that it is investigating the incident and have instructed the occupier, NEA, to stop all electrical maintenance work there.
Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, referred to Thursday's incident as ""unfortunate and upsetting"".
She said in a Facebook post that all three men are Singaporeans and the explosion was contained within the electrical room and did not spread to the rest of the premises.
""I am deeply saddened by this incident, and would like to convey my deepest condolences to the families of the victims. We will investigate the cause of this tragic incident to prevent any future occurrences,"" she said.
In February, anÂ explosionÂ at a building located at 32E Tuas Avenue 10 killed three workers and injured seven others.

24,"Pregnant women at higher risk of severe Covid-19 complications, urged to get vaccinated: MOH
Today (Singapore) - Online
September 24, 2021 Friday","SINGAPORE - Pregnant women are at a higher risk of severe complications from Covid-19 that could lead to death, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak from the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (Sept 24), as he called on them to get vaccinated.
Speaking at a news conference by the Government's Covid-19 task force, the director of medical services at MOH said that several pregnant women had been among some younger Covid-19 patientsÂ admitted to hospital who have not been vaccinated.
""Perhaps, this was because of a concern that the vaccine might affect their ability to get pregnant, or that the vaccine would harm the foetus,"" he said. ""Real-world data has shown the opposite.""
Pregnant women are at a higher risk of getting a more severe infection from the coronavirus, he stressed.
They are also more susceptible to severe complications of either Covid-19 or the pregnancy and are also at a higher risk of needing intensive care and death, he added.
Assoc Prof Mak's comments came as the task force announcedÂ tightened measures to slow down the unexpectedly rapid rise in cases that has put a strain on Singapore's healthcare and response system.
The Academy of Medicine Singapore's College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Obstetrical and Gynecological Society of Singapore have issued strong advice for pregnant women to get vaccinated as soon as possible, he noted.
TODAY reported last week that the Singapore General Hospital was seeing a worrying rise in the number of pregnant women who have Covid-19 being admitted to its isolation wards.
The hospital said then that it had not seen such patients in all of last year and this year until August, and more than 10 cases have been recorded since then. A number of the women needed oxygen support to breathe.
None of these women was fully vaccinated and ""very few"" were partially vaccinated, the hospital had said.
KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), the largest hospital specialising in healthcare for women and children in Singapore, told TODAY last week that it has also seen a ""recent increase"" in the number of pregnant women infected with Covid-19.
From May until mid-August this year, it saw about twice as many such cases. The majority of them were not vaccinated.
In a written parliamentary reply last Monday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has received a small number of non-serious ""adverse event"" reports with the Pfizer-BioNTech or Comirnaty vaccine in pregnant women.
However, he said that these adverse events are similar to those reported in the general population.
Assoc Prof Mak said on Friday: ""Unfortunately, we have already seen some pregnant women in the hospital and in the intensive care units. We do not wish to see many more such cases here.""",Today (Singapore) - Online,24-09-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999973913258443}",en,0.9999973913258443

The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 24, 2021 Friday","Three Singaporean workers were carrying out electrical maintenance work when an explosion occurred at the Tuas Incineration Plant yesterday.
 The blast in the electrical switchroom killed one of them and seriously injured the other two.
 The one who died, a 65-year-old man, was pronounced dead at the scene. The other two men, aged 59 and 64, had burn injuries and were taken to Singapore General Hospital.
 The incident at the plant in Tuas Avenue 20 took place at 3.15pm.
 About 80 people evacuated themselves from the premises, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) in a Facebook post yesterday.
 All other plant workers are safe, and operations at the plant have been safely wound down, said the National Environment Agency, which owns the plant.
 The cause of the fire is being investigated, said SCDF.
 The Ministry of Manpower, which is also investigating the incident, said it has instructed the occupier to stop all electrical maintenance work at the premises.
 SCDF said that when it arrived, it found an electrical switchroom on the first storey smoke-logged and entered the premises with breathing apparatus sets to locate the fire.
 It noted that the fire involved a chimney fan switch in the electrical switchroom.
 SCDF said in a statement that its firefighters extinguished a few pockets of fire with two dry powder fire extinguishers.
 When The Straits Times arrived at the scene at about 4.30pm, several police cars and at least six SCDF vehicles were spotted within the compound.
 Other workers wearing helmets and dressed in light-blue uniforms were gathered outside the building. Police officers were seen speaking to some of them.
 A worker told The Straits Times that the bodies of the two seriously injured workers were blackened and their clothes were torn.
 At about 5pm, four SCDF vehicles, including an ambulance and two fire engines, left the plant.
 Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said in a Facebook post yesterday: ""I am deeply saddened by this incident, and would like to convey my deepest condolences to the families of the victims.
 ""We will investigate the cause of this tragic incident to prevent any future occurrences.""
 The plant is the second refuse incineration plant to be built in Singapore. There are currently four such plants.
 It was constructed at an estimated cost of $200 million and sits on 6.3ha of reclaimed land.
 It is able to incinerate 1,400 tonnes of refuse with its five units of incinerators.
 Before yesterday's incident, the total number of workplace fatalities this year as at September was 27.
 SCDF said that when it arrived, it found an electrical switchroom on the first storey smoke-logged and entered the premises with breathing apparatus sets to locate the fire. It noted that the fire involved a chimney fan switch in the electrical switchroom. On Feb 24, an explosion occurred at an industrial building at 32E Tuas Avenue 11, killing three people.
 Last year, there were 30 workplace fatalities.
 There were 39 workplace deaths in 2019 and 41 in 2018.

26,"Long queue at swab centre for ward visitors at SGH; Approved visitors must show valid test results under new rules; TTSH swab booths less busy
The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 25, 2021 Saturday","At the start of a four-week suspension of hospital visits yesterday, a long queue was seen at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) swab centre for ward visitors, while Tan Tock Seng Hospital's (TTSH) swab booths were less busy earlier in the day.
 During this suspension set to end after Oct 23, visitors are allowed only for certain patients such as those who are critically ill and women who have just given birth, on a case-by-case basis.
 These visitors will have to produce a valid antigen rapid test (ART) or polymerase chain reaction test result obtained within 24 hours of each visit.
 The tests have to be done by Covid-19 test providers approved by the Health Ministry.
 This restriction comes amid a rise in Covid-19 cases and with more infections being detected among hospital staff, patients and visitors.
 Singapore recorded 1,650 new cases yesterday, comprising 1,369 in the community, 277 dormitory residents and four imported cases.
 Ward visitors at TTSH who had not done an ART before visiting the hospital were asked to buy a kit from the hospital's pharmacy and proceed to the designated area for antigen rapid testing.
 A healthcare worker would then assist them with the test at the makeshift area.
 At 11.40am, there were three visitors seated inside the cubicles waiting for their ART results.
 At SGH yesterday afternoon, there was a long line outside the Antigen Rapid Test Centre at Bowyer Block.
 At 1.15pm, there were 24 visitors in line, with more joining during the lunchtime visiting hours.
 Some were shocked and frustrated when they saw the queue outside the centre, but the line moved at a steady pace.
 Among those queueing was sales manager Clara Lam, who was planning to visit her father at Outram Community Hospital next door.
 Her father, who has liver cancer, is critically ill.
 Ms Lam, who is in her 50s, said: ""It would be best for them to speed up and have more staff members at the centre, especially during the noon to 2pm visiting hours.
 ""It took me a while to walk to the centre from Outram Community Hospital, and I am allowed to visit my dad for only 30 minutes.""
 Earlier at TTSH, a few people were seen registering at the visitor service counters - including those whose loved ones had died at the hospital or are on the dangerously ill list.
 One of the first visitors to arrive at 8am was Ms Iris Lim, 48. She was allowed to visit her father, who has been warded in the intensive care unit for lupus and bleeding.
 She said she had taken an ART at a general practitioner's clinic in Yishun on Thursday evening prior to her hospital visit.
 Patients in critical condition are allowed up to five visitors, with a maximum of two visitors at the patient's bedside at any one time.
 Ms Lim, who works in sales, said: ""If I had a choice, I wouldn't want to come to a hospital during this period. Why put ourselves at risk? But my father is in the ICU.""
 She and her siblings will be taking turns to visit him over the next few days.
 By 11.30am, tables at the visitor service counters were filled with food items that caregivers had left for patients whom they could not visit. But the hospital has urged the public not to deliver or drop off items for patients unless they are essential.
 Although there were few ward visitors, TTSH was still bustling with outpatients and their caregivers.
 Ms Lee Peck Hong, 50, was at the hospital to accompany her father for his routine check-up.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 27, 2021 Monday","A second worker has died from the explosion at the Tuas Incineration Plant (TIP) last Thursday.
 The death was confirmed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) yesterday. The executive engineering manager died after succumbing to his injuries yesterday, NEA said in a statement.
 The employee was one of two workers, aged 59 and 64, who had burn injuries after the explosion and were taken to Singapore General Hospital (SGH).
 A 65-year-old senior engineering manager was pronounced dead at the scene by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) on Thursday.
 All three were NEA employees carrying out electrical maintenance work inside an electrical switchgear room when the explosion occurred.
 The remaining worker, an engineering manager, is still in SGH's intensive care unit.
 ""All three NEA officers who were in the switchgear room are senior members of the plant's electrical maintenance branch, each with more than 35 years in service, and have contributed at TIP for many years,"" NEA said yesterday.
 The incident at the plant in Tuas Avenue 20 took place at 3.15pm.
 About 80 people evacuated themselves from the premises, the SCDF said on Thursday.
 All other plant workers were unharmed, and operations at the plant were safely wound down on Thursday after the blast, said NEA, which owns the plant.
 The agency said it remains in daily contact with the officers' families to provide all possible assistance.
 It added that it is working closely with the Ministry of Manpower, SCDF, other technical agencies as well as electrical engineering experts to investigate the cause.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
September 29, 2021 Wednesday","Moments after an explosion shook a Tuas industrial building and blew out its window panels, eight workers who were in a workshop there ran to a nearby open field screaming in agony.
 Workers from neighbouring units hurried to splash water and hose down the badly burnt workers.
 The traumatic experience of the Feb 24 blast at 32E Tuas Avenue 11 was recounted by two of the injured workers, Mr Hossain Jitu, 32, and Mr Molla Md Yousuf, 28, both Bangladeshi nationals, before an inquiry committee yesterday.
 ""We were screaming in pain at the open field, and workers from neighbouring units came out and started throwing and spraying water on us using a water hose,"" Mr Jitu testified.
 ""I realised my shirt was on fire and part of it had already burned off. I removed what was left of my burning shirt using my left hand.""
 Mr Jitu suffered burns to 54 per cent of his body in the incident and later had difficulty breathing and sleeping. ""The skin beneath my eyes was burnt and I was unable to close my eyes and sleep after the accident,"" he said.
 Three workers, Mr Subbaiyan Marimuthu, 38, Mr Anisuzzaman Md, 29, and Mr Shohel Md, 23, died from severe burns that covered 90 per cent of their bodies, while several others including Mr Jitu, Mr Yousuf were injured.
 The inquiry committee, chaired by Senior District Judge Ong Hian Sun, had earlier heard that the explosion is believed to have been linked to a mixer machine.
 The workers in the workshop were employed by Stars Engrg, a company that made an insulation material called fire wrap using the mixer machine. The machine heated up oil in a jacket, which then heated ingredients including potato starch in the mixer component.
 Stars Engrg's sole director, Mr Chua Xing Da, testified earlier that the temperature in the oil jacket was not monitored after the machine was tested on June 12 last year. He separately estimated the temperature of the machine to have been around 700 deg C before the explosion.
 Both Mr Jitu and Mr Yousuf, whose scars were visible yesterday despite them wearing masks, said that when the machine was left on for some time, they would hear bubbling, boiling sounds inside it.
 On the day of the explosion, between 11am and 11.30am, Mr Jitu was at an assembly table, while Mr Yousuf was packing completed fire wraps. ""Suddenly, I felt hot oil splash on my face and the top part of my chest. I also heard oil splashing onto the wall above or behind me... I looked up and the whole workshop was on fire and filled with black smoke,"" Mr Jitu said.
 Mr Yousuf said he heard a loud explosion behind him. ""I felt an extremely intense heat accompanied by an impact across my whole back, and I fell about 2m forward to the ground. I also felt pain.""
 Both men ran out of the workshop to an open field. They were later taken to Singapore General Hospital's burns unit and placed in intensive care.
 Mr Jitu suffered burns on areas including his back, face, neck, chest, arms and thighs, and underwent multiple skin grafting and plastic surgery procedures. Mr Yousuf had burns to his hands, face and back. A skin grafting procedure was performed on his hands.
 Both men continue to receive outpatient care, including physiotherapy. Mr Jitu said he lost strength in his hands after the accident, and cannot open his mouth fully, which has affected his eating.

29,"Group has been holding blood drives since 1978; Singapore Sindhi Association one of first private groups to do so regularly here
The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 4, 2021 Monday","Property consultant Vashi Chandiramani, 63, saw a teenage girl get knocked down by a minibus when he was 16.
 Although he did not know her, he tailed the ambulance to the Singapore General Hospital and found out that she needed an urgent blood transfusion.
 Because she had a rare blood type, the amount of blood she needed was not available.
 Eventually, the problem was solved and the girl was saved, but that incident made him understand how blood banks can save lives.
 When he turned 18, the minimum age to donate blood then, he began the journey towards becoming a champion blood donor.
 Yesterday, at a blood drive held at the Singapore Sindhi Association (SSA), Mr Chandiramani remembered the accident, which happened 47 years ago.
 The SSA adviser and immediate past president said: ""Giving blood is all about saving lives... It is the noblest deed one can do.""
 By 2004, he had donated blood 100 times and later stopped only because he had some health problems that made him ineligible.
 Now, Mr Chandiramani spends his spare time nudging other people to give blood.
 The SSA has been holding annual blood donation drives four times a year since 1978.
 Yesterday, 120 people donated blood at Sindhu House, the SSA headquarters in Mountbatten Road, for the last leg of this year's blood drive. The total number of donors at all SSA blood drives this year is 520, the highest yearly number to date, Mr Chandiramani said.
 Set up in Singapore 100 years ago as a merchants' group, SSA is the oldest Sindhi organisation outside India. It is also one of the first private groups to organise regular blood donation events here.
 In 2004, it was reported that the Sindhi community was among the most active groups of blood donors here, averaging 400 donations a year.
 Mr Chandiramani said SSA has seen more donors, including first-time donors, over the past three years. Before that, each drive did not cross 50 registrants.
 One regular blood donor is Ms Piya Sadhwani, 55, who has been giving blood at SSA events at least twice a year for 25 years.
 If she misses an SSA blood drive, she heads to the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to give blood.
 The Hotel New World collapse in 1986 was what first spurred Ms Sadhwani, a property agent, to think about donating blood.
 ""I followed the news of the disaster on TV, seeing the misery and deaths. The blood centre back then needed a lot of blood,"" she said.
 As her husband and in-laws were regular blood donors, she started going for blood drives after getting married.
 Last month, Singapore's first blood donation app was launched by HSA and the Singapore Red Cross. The app, called DonateBlood, was created to make the process seamless for regular and new donors.
 Donors can use the app to update their health particulars and receive information about their appointments, among other features.",The Straits Times (Singapore),3-010-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.999995920196846}",en,0.999995920196846
30,"Supporters who believe ivermectin can treat Covid-19 unfazed by ill effects; HSA warns self-medicating with drug can be dangerous
Today (Singapore) - Online
October 6, 2021 Wednesday","SINGAPORE - People who support the use of ivermectin to treat Covid-19Â have dug their heels in even after a woman who took the drug fell ill and was hospitalised. They continue to believe that the drug works and said that they are not worried because the drug has a ""good safety record"".
Last Sunday (Oct 3), Facebook user Vanessa Koh Wan Ling said that her 65-year-old mother was hospitalised after taking ivermectin, an anti-parasite pharmaceutical drug, having been urged by her friends to use it to protect herself from Covid-19.
Supporters of the drug are now casting doubt on what caused the woman to fall sick, saying it was likely that she was having side effects from the first dose of a Sinopharm vaccine that she took on Sept 23. They have left messages of their contrary views on several Telegram chat groups and in the comments section of Ms Koh's Facebook post.
On Tuesday after news of the woman's case made the rounds, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) issued a statement on its website to state againÂ that ivermectin is not an anti-viral medicine and is not approved for use to prevent or treat Covid-19.
Self-medicating with the drug can be dangerous, with side effects that include vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain andÂ liver injury (hepatitis). Ivermectin can also interact with other medications such as blood-thinners, it said.
There have already been reports of patients requiring hospitalisation after self-medication with ivermectin, it added.
Since Ms Koh highlighted her mother's predicament on social media on Sunday, there have been close to 2,000 comments left on her post.
Some Facebook users accused her of blowing things out of proportion, or questioned her about how she came to the conclusion that her mother was suffering from side effects of ivermectin, saying it could be side effects from the Sinopharm vaccine or from other drugs if she has pre-existing medical conditions.
Others wrote to insist that ivermectin is a treatment for Covid-19, or that the mother could be one of the ""unlucky"" few to be allergic to the drug, or that the drug that she bought was not authentic.
In one reply to the torrentÂ of comments, Ms Koh said that since her mother received her first vaccine shot, a friend had ""persistently"" asked her mother ""every day"" if she had side effects yet, and sent her anti-vaccination messages on the consequences of getting vaccinated.
However, every day, her mother replied to the friend that she has had no side effects from the Sinopharm vaccine she took, Ms Koh said.
TODAY had reached out to Sengkang General Hospital, where the woman is under observation, to ask about her condition and the cause of her illness.
Due to patient confidentiality, the hospital was unable to give any information.Â Â 
Ivermectin cannot be bought over the counter here and only via a prescription when used to treat parasite infestations in humans such as head lice.
Ms Koh wrote on Facebook that based on her mother's phone messages, the transaction for the pills was ""done via Telegram in an anti-government chat"" group.
She also said that her mother has been receiving messages with weblinks to anti-vaccination or anti-government articles and videos ""daily"".
'NOT WORRIED AT ALL'
Ms Iris Koh, 45, is the founder of a group called Healing The Divide. On its website, the group states that it brings together Singaporeans concerned about Covid-19 vaccines.
Ms Iris Koh said that she has been given ivermectin by friends and would take the drug if she thinks Covid-19 is ""getting out of hand"".
""Or if I am going to be interacting with many people, I may start the prevention protocol. I currently spend very little time interacting with people face to face, so I'm still not worried.""Â 
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that ivermectin should be used to treat Covid-19 only in clinical trials and that evidence on its effectiveness against the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus causing Covid-19 was ""inconclusive"".
In its statement on Tuesday, HSA also said that to date, there is no scientific evidence from properly conducted clinical trials to prove that ivermectin is effective against Covid-19.
A study in Singapore done by the National University Health System last year did not find any evidence suggesting that ivermectin has any effect on Covid-19 either.
Ms Cheryl Lee, 62, a social entrepreneur, told TODAY that she has been taking the drug for more than three months as a ""prophylactic"" to prevent catching the disease and she gets her supply from a seller in India.
""Last weekend, I reluctantly took my first dose of Sinopharm because I want to travel soon and not be restricted in my movements. Otherwise, I am confident that ivermectin will protect me from being infected and from severe Covid-19,"" she said.
One man, who did not wish to be identified, said that he had taken just one pill of ivermectin ""to see if there are any side effects"" and there has been none.
He said that he is ""not worried at all"" even though people have been hospitalised from self-medicating on the drug.
""Ivermectin has been used on humans for the past 40 years,"" he added.
Another prospective ivermectin user here, who wanted to be known only as Syn Jae, 27, is also not worried due to the drug's ""extensive safety track record"".
PENALTIES FOR ILLEGAL SALES
In her Facebook post on Sunday, Ms Vanessa Koh said that after taking ivermectin, her mother was vomiting, had nausea, dizziness andÂ severe joint pain, could not walk and stand, and other symptoms.
She said that her mother's friends whom she knew from church had convinced her to take ivermectin to ""purge"" Covid-19 and its vaccine out of her system.
The chat group she saw on her mother's phone was selling 1,000 pills of ivermectin for S$110 in 3mg or 12mg.Â 
TODAY reported last month that there are people here buying ivermectin online.
HSA said: ""Consumers are strongly advised not to self-medicate with ivermectin and to consult their doctor for proper treatment of Covid-19.
""HSA takes a serious view against those engaged in the illegal sale and supply of medicines, including ivermectin, and we will take strong enforcement action against such persons.""
Anyone convicted of illegally selling ivermectin can be fined up to S$50,000 or be jailed for up to two years, or both, under the Health Products Act
Responding to TODAY's queries, the National University Hospital said that it has not seen patients requesting ivermectin or being admitted after taking it.
Other public hospitals did not respond to TODAY's queries by Wednesday. These included KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore General Hospital, Changi General Hospital, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital.
Among the private hospitals, Thomson Medical Centre and Farrer Park Hospital said that they have not had any patients admitted for conditions related to ivermectin side effects. Mount Alvernia Hospital declined comment.
In the United States, The New York Times reported that prescriptions for ivermectin have risen sharply in recent weeks, jumping to more than 88,000 a week in mid-August from a pre-pandemic baseline average of 3,600 a week.
It was also reported that hospitals and poison control centres across the US are treating a growing number of patients taking the drug, including hospitalisations and those who have had ""altered mental statuses"".
Some people in the US have bought the drug from veterinary supply stores and possibly consumed it in large doses meant for livestock.
The US Food and Drug Administration said on its website that it has not authorised or approved ivermectin for use in preventing or treating Covid-19 in humans or animals. ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY NAVENE ELANGOVAN

33,"Hawker gets jail, fine after meat grinder severed 4 of maid's fingers while she worked for him illegally
Today (Singapore) - Online
October 8, 2021 Friday","SINGAPORE - A wanton noodle stall owner who got his daughter's domestic helper to work for him illegally was jailed for two weeks and fined S$19,000 after the helper's fingers were cut off by an electric meat grinder.
Lim Sheng Song, 59, had failed to ensure that the helper, Ms Su Su Mar, was properly trained to use the machine and that it was safe for use.
When the foreign domestic worker from Myanmar dropped a butter knife into the grinder, she tried to retrieve it by placing her hand through its opening without first switching it off, severing four of her fingers.
Lim, who owns the Xin Ji noodle stall in Tampines, had earlier pleaded guilty to offences including one charge under the Workplace Safety and Health Act, and two charges under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. Another similar charge was taken into consideration for sentencing.

Besides Ms Su Su Mar, court documents stated that Lim also got two other domestic workers to help out illegally at his stall, one of whom was in his employ.
His daughter, Lim Sock Hong, was earlier fined S$7,000. The 36-year-old pleaded guilty to allowing the women whom she had employed to work as kitchen assistants for her father at the stall.
Lim's wife, Koh Siew Imm, 59, was given a stern warning for similarly instructing the workers to help out in running the business. The prosecution had withdrawn two charges against her.
WHAT HAPPENED
Court documents stated that Ms Su Su Mar was hired by Lim Sock Hong but had never actually worked for her throughout her employment.
From November 2017 to January 2019, Ms Su Su Mar had instead been working and residing with Lim Sheng Song who lived separately from his daughter.
At Lim's home, Ms Su Su Mar was instructed to prepare the wanton dumplings and grind chilli using an electric meat grinder.
She did this daily from 2am to 7pm, taking a rest from 7am to 9.30am, except on Wednesdays when the stall was closed. This was on top of about an hour's worth of household chores.
She was not paid extra for assisting in the food stall business and earned S$600 a month, inclusive of day-off compensation.
On Jan 31, 2019, Ms Su Su Mar was working in the kitchen of Lim's Loyang home when she used a butter knife to push ingredients into the meat grinder.
When the knife slipped from her hand, she immediately tried to retrieve the knife by placing her right hand through the opening of the grinder without switching it off.
The blade in the grinder severed four of her fingers. She was taken to the Singapore General Hospital for treatment and as a result, the four fingers were amputated.
Investigations revealed that the grinder came with a plastic hoop that prevents a user's hands from reaching the mincing component of the grinder.
However, the plastic hoop was broken and discarded, and Lim knew this.
Investigations also showed that the grinder came with a push tool with a long handle that allowed a user to push ingredients into the grinder. Ms Su Su Mar used a butter knife instead.
Lim had earlier also made another maid work as his kitchen helper from 2015 to 2018.
For each charge of employing a foreign worker as a kitchen helper without a valid work pass, Lim could have been fined up to S$30,000, jailed for up to a year, or punished with both. For failing to take necessary measures to ensure the safety and health of his employee at work, he could have been fined up to S$200,000, jailed for up to two years, or punished with both.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 9, 2021 Saturday","Mr Alfred and his family were on a quarantine order but, together with their helper, fled from their flat as their neighbour's unit below caught fire.
 The 40-year-old educator, who declined to give his full name, said they had to choose between running or suffocating in their home.
 He and his wife, three children, mother-in-law and the helper took the lift to the ground floor, where they joined neighbours who had gathered at the foot of the block.
 A fire had broken out in a flat on the 14th floor of Block 13 Ghim Moh Road at about 10am yesterday.
 Thick black smoke was seen coming from the unit.
 Mr Alfred, who lives two floors above the affected unit, said his family initially thought it was just someone burning incense. But the smoke soon became unbearable.
 Then personnel from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) arrived and went door to door to get residents to evacuate.
 Mr Alfred said: ""Under the circumstances, we had no choice. It all happened fairly quickly as the smoke became dark very fast. When we escaped downstairs, we made sure to keep a safe distance from everyone else because we're still on our last day of quarantine order.""
 Their helper had tested positive for Covid-19, hence the quarantine order for the family, he said, adding that they have been testing negative for the coronavirus over the past few days.
 The SCDF said about 80 people were evacuated from the block.
 Firefighters had to force their way into the unit to extinguish the blaze, which involved the contents of the living room.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 9, 2021 Saturday","A fire that broke out in a fifth-floor unit of a Jurong West block early yesterday left one man dead and several others injured.
 About 60 residents of Block 978 in Jurong West Street 93 were also evacuated at around 2.30am.
 The fire was suspected to have been caused by a personal mobility device (PMD).
 Housewife Indra Thevi, who lives on the second floor of the block, was awoken by shouting and loud footsteps. The 52-year-old said the smell of smoke was thick in the air and her family of three, still clad in pyjamas, promptly left their flat.
 She saw clothes being thrown out of a fifth-floor unit from which thick black smoke was billowing.
 Two men from the burning unit, believed to be roommates aged 31 and 51, climbed out of a window onto the air-conditioner ledge in an attempt to escape the blaze.
 They crouched in a narrow space next to the compressor, shouting.
 Madam Indra told The Straits Times she was concerned for their safety: ""They were shouting, 'tolong, tolong' to try to get the attention of the people below. I was quite worried they were going to fall.""
 The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said firefighters forced their way into a bedroom to rescue the two men who did not want to be taken to hospital.
 A 22-year-old man was found in the bedroom where the fire occurred. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
 Another occupant of the unit, a 24-year-old man, had evacuated before the SCDF arrived. He was taken to the Singapore General Hospital for burn injuries.
 Two firefighters were assessed by paramedics to have experienced heat exhaustion and taken to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital. They have since been discharged.
 Among the 60 residents who were evacuated by the police was student Pranita Bose, 12, who lives on the fourth floor of the block.
 She said her elder sister had been awoken by the smell of burning plastic and heard firefighters shouting. The older girl alerted their parents and the family quickly left the flat.
 Pranita said she saw a man with burns on his back and another who appeared to be in shock. She said: ""I was quite scared that my family's belongings would be affected, as I didn't know how bad the fire was.""
 Another resident who lives on the seventh floor and who wanted to be known only as Madam Yew, 71, said she was worried she could not escape quickly enough, as she has difficulty moving around.
 ""I was so scared, I was shaking all over,"" she said in Mandarin.
 Residents ST spoke to said they were not familiar with the flat's occupants. According to Chinese evening daily Shin Min Daily News, they were Chinese Malaysian tenants renting the five-room flat.
 Consultant Noura Ramdzan, 52, who lives on the second floor, said she last saw two of them two days ago, carrying a PMD up the stairs.
 A 69-year-old housewife who wanted to be known only as Madam Ng and who lives directly above the affected unit, said the floor of her living room and one of the bedrooms remained hot almost 12 hours after the fire.
 She was shocked when she learnt someone had died in the unit. She said: ""It's so scary that a life can be lost just like that.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),8-010-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999978258623287}",en,0.9999978258623287

The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 10, 2021 Sunday","About 100 residents evacuated their flats after a fire broke out on the 15th storey of Block 116A Rivervale Drive in Sengkang yesterday.
 The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a Facebook post that it was alerted to the fire at about 1.40pm.
 When SCDF officers arrived, they found the fire raging inside a unit, with no one at home.
 The blaze involved the contents of a bedroom and was extinguished with a water jet.
 Prior to the officers arriving, an occupant of the burning unit who was coming home was overcome by heavy smoke at the lift lobby of the 15th floor, the SCDF said.
 She was later taken to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for smoke inhalation.
 One of those who evacuated was Madam Karine Goh, 49, a tutor who lives on the 17th storey.
 She told The Sunday Times that she saw billowing black smoke from her master bedroom and quickly turned off all electrical appliances. ""I ran outside and told my neighbours to evacuate while my husband went to the burning unit to see if anyone needed help.""
 Residents said the affected unit's occupants were a couple, their children - an eight-year-old girl and two others in their 20s - and their helper.
 A resident who wanted to be known only as Mr Ahmed, a 43-year-old professional in the media industry, said the child and the helper were at the playground when the fire broke out.
 ""When they returned home from the playground and went up to the unit, they saw smoke coming out of their flat. The helper was later taken to hospital, as she was very shaken by the incident,"" he said.
 Ms Choong Xinyi, a 20-year-old student who lives on the 14th floor, said she initially thought people were burning incense.
 But when she realised it was a fire, her first thought was to check if anyone was in the burning flat.
 She said: ""I quickly alerted the neighbours on the same level and went upstairs to see if anyone was stuck in the burning unit.""

38,"Diagnosed with breast cancer at 37 and pregnant; Ms Idah Chia powered through chemotherapy while expecting, and three weeks after giving birth to her son prematurely, she underwent surgery to remove the lump in her breast
The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 10, 2021 Sunday","In June last year, Ms Idah Chia kept feeling a pins-and-needles sensation in a lump on her left breast.
 The lump had formed in 2018 after she stopped breastfeeding her son Aidan. A doctor had treated and tested it, giving her the all-clear by the end of that year.
 Still, her mother urged her to get it checked. An ultrasound in mid-September last year led to a biopsy.
 Two weeks later, on Oct 6, she found out she had triple negative breast cancer, a particularly aggressive form that doctors are seeing more of in younger women like her, who are below age 40 and with no family history of the condition.
 ""Once you hear the word 'cancer' from your doctor, you don't hear anything else that she tells you, what the treatments are. Everything just stops,"" she recalls in a Zoom interview.
 She was one month shy of her 37th birthday. Aidan was just two years old.
 Her husband, Mr Clayton Hosanna, 35, had accompanied her to the appointment and promised to take her to lunch, hoping to raise her spirits. All their plans fell away as the couple walked, shell-shocked, out of the doctor's room to a quiet corner.
 ""He hugged me because I was crying. He was reassuring me, saying that we would get through it together.""
 A week after her diagnosis, she found out she was four weeks pregnant. The couple had been trying for another baby for a while without success, so it did not occur to her that she could have conceived since.
 At the time, she was about to go on fertility drugs to freeze her eggs for use after her chemotherapy treatment. Her gynaecologist did a pregnancy test after noticing her elevated hormone levels.
 ""I broke down and cried the entire day,"" she says of the happy surprise that turned bittersweet.
 ""I worried about the effects on the baby because I had gone through so many scans, mammograms and things that you should not be doing when you're pregnant.""
 Still, she was glad she opted to freeze her embryos after her diagnosis, as chemotherapy during the first trimester would have been very dangerous for the foetus.
 Ms Chia says her doctors were concerned about her mental health, as the many potential complications of a normal pregnancy were compounded by her breast cancer. But she told herself that whatever happened to the pregnancy, she would accept it. ""I would have to be strong for my family.""
 The plan then was to start her chemotherapy treatment in the second trimester, when it would be safer for the foetus. She would have sessions every three weeks for the first three months, followed by a short respite and then weekly sessions for the remaining three months or so.
 The chemotherapy gave her side effects similar to pregnancy symptoms - fatigue, nausea and vomiting.
 Little Aidan cried, ""Put back mama's hair"", when his father shaved Ms Chia's locks off at her request after her hair started falling out because of the treatment.
 Her frequent hospital visits took a toll on the toddler, who was still in playgroup at the time. His teacher told her that whenever they asked him about his mother, he would frown and say: ""Mama go to hospital, mama see doctor.""
 ""I was so xin teng (Mandarin for heartache) for him,"" she says.
 Her second child was due in late June, but in mid-April, she had a bout of cramps at night. She dismissed them, but when she woke up to give Aidan milk during the night, she felt ""the gush of something coming out"".
 It was blood.
 Recalling her gynaecologist's advice, she rushed to the hospital to find that she was 2cm dilated.
 ""There was so much going on, with the breast cancer, chemotherapy and then going into early labour,"" she says.
 ""I pushed everything aside. I didn't want to think so much. I just concentrated on giving birth to my son.""
 Delivered prematurely at 29 weeks and four days, baby Noah was rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).
 ""I asked the doctors if my baby was okay because of how strong chemo drugs are,"" Ms Chia recalls. ""I just wanted to know that he was safe and healthy.""
 He had issues like underdeveloped lungs, which are common in premature newborns, but he was very strong, she adds. After about 10 days, he was transferred to a high dependency ward for 11/2 months.
 Still, she remembers looking at Noah's tiny body, riddled with wires in the incubator, and thinking to herself: ""How I wish I could take his place.""
 She recalls: ""He was so tiny and so fragile.""
 While he was fighting to grow, his mother was fighting her own battle to live.
 She had reacted well to the chemotherapy drugs, so much so that she ""couldn't feel the lump any more"". Doctors recommended bringing forward her lumpectomy to remove it.
 As Noah was still in the hospital and being cared for, she thought it would be a good time to get as much of her own surgery done as possible.
 Three weeks after giving birth, she went under the knife.
 During Noah's extended hospitalisation, she visited him every two days or so, shuttling between SGH where he was, and Sengkang General Hospital for her own treatment, where ""the chemo really drained my energy"".
 The guilt of not being with him tugged at her - ""I felt so dui bu qi (Mandarin for sorry)"" - but at the same time, she knew he was being well cared for.
 In between all this, she still managed to get vaccinated against Covid-19 in July and August after finishing her chemotherapy. She followed that up with radiation therapy, and is now considered to be in remission, although she has to visit her doctors every quarter.
 Ms Chia, who celebrates her 38th birthday next month, will soon return to her job as an administrative manager after taking prolonged medical leave with her bosses' support.
 Noah, she reports happily, is doing very well for his corrected age as a premature baby.
 ""It's really been a roller coaster of emotions,"" she says of the last year. When she feels down, she tries to focus on her children and family and to think positively.
 ""You love more, you feel more. Everything is heightened and every day that I wake up, I feel so blessed to be there, even though I'm in pain,"" she says. She still feels a ""tingling sensation"" in the area.
 She credits her family for rallying around her, especially her husband, who handled everything from housework to cooking to minding Aidan so she could rest after chemotherapy.
 Mr Hosanna, a superintendent in the marine offshore industry, says he tried to be there for his wife ""physically and mentally"".
 ""She's very strong,"" he adds.
 Ms Chia now uses her Instagram account (@idahchialixin) to share her journey of hope with other women, whom she says have reached out to share their cancer concerns with her.
 ""Two years ago, I would never have thought that I would have cancer. That's the danger - because when we are young, we are complacent, thinking we are healthy and nothing can get us. We're so busy and we think everything should be fine,"" she says.
 ""Breast cancer can happen at any age. It does not discriminate whether you're a career woman or a busy mother, or have no family history of cancer.

39,"Check your mouths regularly, doctors urge, as oral cancer patients get younger
Channel NewsAsia
October 12, 2021 Tuesday 6:02 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: Mr Jesse Pangelinan saw a ""perfect red circle"" on his left inner cheek one day in August last year when he was brushing his teeth.
He suspected it could be a sign of oral cancer. But instead of seeing a doctor, he decided to self-medicate.
The ulcer, which was indeed a sign of oral cancer, eventually grew so big that surgery to remove it has left him without parts of his lip and his cheek.
At the time, the 32-year-old was apart from his wife who was in Singapore and hid the problem from her. Mr Pangelinan was in the Northern Mariana Islands, a part of the United States where he would travel frequently to for his job as a lecturer in a community college.
In January this year, when the Singapore permanent resident was still in the Marianas where he was born, he went for a free oral cancer screening and a biopsy confirmed that he had the disease. Oral cancer is common there as betel nut leaf chewing - one of the risk factors for the illness - is prevalent there, said Mr Pangelinan who had the habit growing up.
It became harder for Mr Pangelinan to hide the problem - the tumour had grown so large that it could be seen when he was talking.
""Whenever I talk, you can start to see like it was kind of growing already. You can see there's something in my mouth,"" he said.
Although she could not see him physically, his wife, a Singaporean, noticed the growth over a video call.
""My mouth was already starting to droop because the tumour had already grown ... My wife thought I had a stroke,"" he said.
He could not fully close his mouth and was ""constantly drooling"".
""I always had to have something with me to wipe up the pus, and it was bleeding too ... it was so nasty,"" he said.
Mr Pangelinan came to Singapore in February this year to seek treatment at the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS). By then, his disease had reached an advanced stage - the growth had pierced the skin of his face and was protruding out of it. An operation to remove the tumour was successful, but parts of his cheek and lips had to be removed, along with the teeth on the left side of his mouth where the tumour was.
While that has left a permanent scar on his face, Mr Pangelinan is able to speak and eat normally, although he can only take in smaller portions at a time as he is unable to open his mouth as wide as before.
IMPORTANCE OF DOING SELF-CHECKS
Seeking treatment for oral cancer late can lead to issues with swallowing and speech, said Professor Gopal Iyer, a head and neck cancer surgeon.
As the tumour progresses, the portions of the tongue or other parts of the oral cavity that need to be removed become more ""extensive"", said Prof Iyer, who is head of the department of head and neck surgery at Singapore General Hospital and NCCS. The survival rate also drops in later stages of oral cancer, which is the most common head and neck cancer the centre sees, said Dr Iyer, who is also Mr Pangelinan's doctor.
Among those who seek treatment early, the survival rate is ""upwards of"" 85 to 90 per cent. However, among those who present late, this rate drops to 40 per cent, he said.
The cancer progresses fast as well. ""(In) two to three months you can go from Stage 2 to Stage 4,"" said Dr Iyer.
Oral cancer patients make up an average of 100 patients out of about 800 new head and neck cancer patients annually at NCCS.
This underscores the importance of people checking their mouths for early signs and symptoms, said Dr Iyer.
""The oral cavity is so easy to examine, it's not something that needs anything beyond really good lighting, a mirror and awareness.
""There's a disproportion between how easy it is to identify and diagnosis, versus those patients that do present late ... we want to break that cycle.""
People should look out for things like ulcers that do not heal within two weeks, red or white patches that ""you cannot brush away"", and lumps with some blood, he said. Other signs to look out for are difficulty swallowing and soreness at a particular site, he added.
""It's important to talk about this because we do see an increasing trend in oral cancers in younger patients,"" Dr Iyer said.
Oral cancer patients in Singapore used to be mostly in their 60s and 70s, but more are now in their 50s and 60s. Dr Iyer said NCCS sees some patients in their 20s and 30s - and even teens - although these cases are rare.
""We see a much younger group of non-smokers, non-drinkers having oral cancers. The reasons are unknown,"" he said.
Risk factors for oral cancer include tobacco use, which includes smoking, second-hand smoking and chewing tobacco, excessive alcohol use and trauma to the mouth caused by sharp teeth or bad dentures.
Dr Iyer said that dentists are the ""best port of call"" when patients are in doubt as they are trained to pick up signs of oral cancer.
HOW A DENTIST CAN HELP
Dr Chelsia Sim, senior consultant in oral and maxillofacial surgery at the National Dental Centre Singapore, said that dentists are trained to examine the oral mucosa and teeth.
""We are familiar with the normal structures in the oral cavity and hence can pick up on abnormalities which can be pre-cancerous changes,"" she said.
Dentists look out for white or red patches as well as persistent ulcers or sores in the mouth that do not heal after two to three weeks, she said.
""We also check for swellings, lumps or bumps inside the mouth, either on the gums, tongue, lips, floor of mouth or the roof of the mouth,"" she said.
She echoed Dr Iyer's view on the importance of checking the mouth for symptoms regularly for early detection of any pre-cancerous lesions.
""People should perform self-checks to look for any irregularities and if they notice any changes in their mouth or find any of the above symptoms, they should see their dentist immediately to get a thorough oral examination,"" she said.
However, given that sometimes symptoms may be hard to spot or too small to see, she suggested seeing a doctor at least once a year for an oral examination.
Dr Sim said that a lack of awareness can delay the diagnosis of oral cancer as most of the pre-cancerous symptoms are painless.
""When they start to notice these changes when it becomes painful, it is highly likely that the cancer has spread deep and this will impact the outcome of treatment,"" she said.

His advice for others is to seek treatment early.

40,"'I haven't seen the daylight in ages': Pressure on healthcare workers as COVID-19 cases spike
Channel NewsAsia
October 14, 2021 Thursday 6:02 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: Nearly two years after the coronavirus first emerged, Singapore is transitioning to a new normal and learning to live with COVID-19.
The focus has shifted to preventing severe illness and death. More vaccinated travel lanes are opening and healthcare protocols for infected people have been simplified.
But for healthcare workers here, the end of the pandemic is nowhere in sight.
""I haven't seen the daylight in ages,"" said one junior doctor, who works at a public hospital in Singapore.
Healthcare workers interviewed for this story cannot be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
""The healthcare system is strained to the maximum now and will continue to be,"" he said, adding that his hospital has seen patient admissions double since last week.
""This will only end once the numbers come down but who knows when this will be?""
Singapore's soaring COVID-19 cases - between 2,000 and 4,000 cases a day have been reported for the past two weeks - have placed significant strain on its healthcare system. Waiting times and bed occupancy rates at hospitals have surged.
New wards appeared to be opening ""almost every day"" over the past few months, said healthcare workers from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and hospitals such as Singapore General Hospital and Changi General Hospital.
""I've experienced situations where a ward opens at around 9pm, and by 10pm there are already more than 10 patients coming at one go, waiting for me to see them ... I have never had such a depressing call throughout my medical life,"" said one medical officer from NCID.
""The wards are designed for infectious diseases ... it's supposed to be one patient isolated in a single room and so, we tried at first to accommodate this by opening new wards.""
But with patients coming in ""non-stop"", two or even three patients are now being put in a single room, he said.
Among hospitals tracked by the Ministry of Health (MOH), latest figures show that daily bed occupancy rates ranged from 75 per cent to nearly 95 per cent from Sep 26 to Oct 2. Last week, MOH said that the occupancy for COVID-19 isolation beds has increased from 62 per cent in July to 85 per cent, with an eight-fold increase in COVID-19 patients seeking medical attention at emergency departments over the past three months.
""It does put pressure on our resources because while you can open more beds to take in more patients, you also need more nurses and doctors to take care of them,"" said another healthcare worker at Changi General Hospital.
""For a nurse to handle one patient in the ICU is not easy. So sometimes, they have two nurses to one patient, and they help each other,"" he said, adding that junior doctors are also placed on duty to help out.
CNA has contacted MOH for more information about the intensive care situation at hospitals. WORRYING SITUATION
Singapore now has around 2,500 COVID-19 beds, up from 900 previously. Of these, about 170 are intensive care beds, and another 100 can be converted into ICU beds if necessary, said MOH.
Nine COVID-19 treatment facilities with an overall capacity of 3,700 beds will also be set up in the coming weeks to care for higher-risk patients who require observation but do not need to be hospitalised, MOH said. In the meantime, the country is shifting to home recovery as the default care arrangement for the majority of COVID-19 patients.
While this could help to ease the strain on the healthcare system, hospital workers CNA spoke to said it does not mean that their workload has been reduced.
""The majority of people who are admitted now are those who cannot self-isolate or do not fit the criteria for isolation facilities,"" said one junior doctor.
""So even if it's just, say, 2 per cent of patients who require hospital care - that's still a lot.""
The expansion of the home recovery programme also means that the profile of COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospitals has changed, said an NCID medical officer.
""The patients that we're seeing now have much more severe illnesses, with a lot of medical problems, multiple issues on top of COVID-19 and they are also very old,"" he said.
""We no longer see any healthy patients with minimal symptoms, which also means that we're dealing with very complicated cases."" With the surge in local COVID-19 cases, some healthcare workers say they are now being pushed to the limit.
""We've been dealing with COVID-19 over the past two years but I don't think the situation has gotten as bad as it is now,"" said Jessica (not her real name), who works as a doctor at a public hospital.
""Whenever we hear that hospitals will ramp up bed and intensive care unit capacities, it does make us feel like - where do you think this manpower is going to come from?"" she said.
""At the beginning of COVID-19, we went through this whole mess where our annual leave (days) were cancelled and sometimes, we wouldn't get weekends off until further notice,"" she said. ""If the situation gets really crazy, then we could see that again.""
Jessica said she has not had a day off in nearly three weeks.
All applications for overseas travel have also been suspended by MOH Holdings, a move that has stirred further unhappiness among staff, healthcare workers told CNA.
MOH Holdings is the holding company of Singapore's public healthcare clusters National University Health System, National Healthcare Group and Singapore Health Services.
""With the opening of the travel lanes, many of us are upset that we have been recently banned from all travel until further notice,"" said Jessica.
NOT ENOUGH MANPOWER
Last year, the number of nurses in Singapore fell for the first time in at least 15 years.
There were 42,096 nurses in 2020, 572 fewer than the previous year, according to the Singapore Nursing Board's annual report.
MOH said last week that it will bring in more manpower by reaching out to those registered with the Singapore Healthcare Corps, as well as nurses registered with the nursing board but are not in active practice.
So far, about 900 people have stepped forward in response, and will be progressively referred to public hospitals to be matched with suitable roles, said the ministry.
Tan Tock Seng Hospital has also started a new para-nursing initiative in September to boost its manpower. About 150 non-nursing employees will be trained to carry out essential, low-risk nursing tasks such as measuring patients' vital signs and supporting care at the bedside.
These employees will support nurses in their work, freeing them up to concentrate on clinical care for patients.
But increasing the number of doctors and nurses in ICUs and high dependency units may not be so simple, said one doctor working in the infectious disease department at a public hospital. He asked that his workplace not be identified to protect his identity.
""Now that the number of cases has increased so much, they are adding bed capacity, but it's not so simple for manpower ... We need people who are actually trained in ICU and HDU (high dependency unit) to handle these patients, and there are not many of those around,"" he said.
""So, we have no choice but to stretch ourselves and just take on more patients.""
Repeated calls for more manpower earlier this year had mostly gone unheard by his hospital's management.
""I kept telling the hospital management that things are only going to get worse and asked if we could get more manpower, but the sense that I got from them was an unwillingness to provide that,"" he said.
""It was only when things started to go over the edge then they started listening to us, and opened more wards and (added) more manpower.""
HOSPITALS IN CONSTANT STATE OF FLUX
Beyond staffing shortages, healthcare workers have also had to grapple with changing COVID-19 protocols in hospitals.
""It's extremely frustrating because things keep changing every single day,"" said Jessica. ""A ward can be designated as a COVID-19 ward one day, only for it to change the next day. You also have wards that are constantly opening or being closed down, as well as changes to the frequency of swabs for patients and what safety measures we have to adhere to.
""So we have to keep up with all these changes, and it's just additional confusion and administrative work for us, on top of caring for patients."" Changes in rules and procedures have also created frustration among patients, doctors told CNA.
""It's very difficult for them to keep up with all the changes because one day their family can visit them, and then the next day, they may not be allowed to visit, so they get upset,"" one doctor said.
""And when they get upset, it affects us too, because the patients or their family will start questioning us about why visits are not allowed.""
In some cases, patients and their family members get agitated. Jessica said she has been shouted at and verbally abused on several occasions.
""Some of them may give excuses such as saying that it's their parent's birthday ... but we have to be firm and tell them no. Because of that, we receive a lot of anger and frustration,"" she said.
""It happens quite frequently, and if you're not experienced or used to it, it can shake you up quite a bit.""
A LONG ROAD AHEAD
Battered and burned out, doctors and nurses say they hope that people will be more understanding of the challenges healthcare workers face.
""Even though our Government is preparing for so many ICU beds, there are repercussions for this and the hospital is really under strain right now,"" said a doctor.
""So to those who are healthy and walking around now, I do hope they act responsibly and get vaccinated, so they don't end up in the hospital,"" he added. Adding to their stress is the constant worry that they might get COVID-19 and infect others, hospital workers said.
""There have been at least three times where I had been exposed to a patient, without knowing that they had COVID-19 - meaning they turned positive only after being admitted to the hospital,"" said Jessica.
She moved out of her home nearly 10 months ago to minimise the risk of exposing her family to the virus.
""You never know which of your patients or colleagues have COVID-19, so that's really scary and adds to the psychological stress we face,"" she said.
Authorities said last week that COVID-19 booster shots will be extended to healthcare and frontline COVID-19 workers who are at greater risk of infection.
While most welcomed the news, ultimately what they are looking forward to - like everyone else - is the day the pandemic is finally over.
""I can't wait to travel, but more importantly, I just want to take a break and rest,"" said Jessica. INITIAL: vl(cy)",Channel NewsAsia,29-011-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999969273570793}",en,0.9999969273570793
41,"Drug trial for those with aggressive breast cancer; Bexarotene may help eliminate tumour more effectively amid limited treatment options
The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 18, 2021 Monday","An orally consumed anti-cancer drug known as Bexarotene offers new hope to patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) - an aggressive form of breast cancer that appears more frequently among women below 40.
 The drug has been found to be able to tame highly aggressive and invasive breast cancer cells by converting them from a more aggressive cell state (mesenchymal) into a milder one (epithelial). This primes the cancer cells to better respond to chemotherapy and allows for more effective elimination of the tumour and a lower chance of relapse.
 A three-year clinical trial to test this new method of treatment started last October. The aim is to recruit 12 patients, but this can be increased to 20.
 Patients enrolled in the trial, named Bexmet, are given Bexarotene during a lead-in period of two weeks before the start of a treatment cycle. Each cycle involves taking the oral chemotherapy drug Capecitabine for two weeks, followed by a week of Bexarotene. This cycle is repeated so long as the patient is responsive to treatment.
 For patients who complete the entire trial, a total of four biopsies of the tumour tissue are taken: pre-treatment, after the two-week Bexarotene lead-in period, after two weeks of Capecitabine in the first cycle, and upon disease progression.
 Biopsy is a procedure that extracts tissue samples from the tumour.
 The trial is currently open to TNBC patients whose cancer is metastatic - when the cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. Those interested need to fulfil certain eligibility criteria and be assessed by a doctor.
 The Bexarotene-Capecitabine combination was developed by clinicians and scientists from National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS), Singapore General Hospital and the Genome Institute of Singapore at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.
 Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Singapore, with the number of new cases increasing rapidly. From 2014 to 2018, there were 11,232 new cases of breast cancer here, exceeding the number of new cases of colon cancer in women and men in the same period.
 TNBC is a more aggressive form of breast cancer compared with other subtypes and accounts for 10 per cent to 15 per cent of all breast cancers. It tests negative for the oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epithelial growth factor receptor-2, hence the ""triple-negative"" in its name.
 Without these receptor targets, TNBC is more difficult to cure. And with limited treatment options available, chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment.
 The risk of recurrence for TNBC is also higher compared with other breast cancer types, said Dr Elaine Lim, a senior consultant in the department of breast and gynaecology at NCCS.
 Bexmet uses a novel concept of changing cell states, in order to increase the susceptibility to available chemotherapy, she noted. ""We want to see if the breast cancer cells will exhibit the same kind of molecular changes as were observed in our pre-clinical work.""
 The development of oncology drugs is costly, and affordability and accessibility can be a challenge. Hence, altering cancer cell states to make them more susceptible to chemotherapy may be a cost-effective way to treat TNBC and, potentially, other cancers.
 Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Singapore, with the number of new cases increasing rapidly. From 2014 to 2018, there were 11,232 new cases of breast cancer here, exceeding the number of new cases of colon cancer in women and men in the same period. Currently, immunotherapy is a treatment option for TNBC patients. This involves drugs that employ the patient's own immune system to fight the cancer. But it is expensive and a patient is likely to need multiple sessions, said Dr Lim, who is the clinical trial lead.
 A cycle of the Bexarotene-Capecitabine treatment is expected to be much more affordable, given the lower costs of Bexarotene and Capecitabine.

42,"8 coroner cases reopened after alleged forgery by cop; No miscarriage of justice found in six cases; investigation officer allegedly forged statements
The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 19, 2021 Tuesday","Eight coroner's inquiries that were earlier concluded have been reopened over allegations that the investigation officer (IO) who handled the cases had forged statements from people, including family members of the dead.
 The court heard yesterday that the cases involved the officer, Station Inspector Kenny Cheong Chyuan Lih, whose alleged offences came to light following investigations by the Internal Affairs Office of the Singapore Police Force.
 Responding to queries from The Straits Times yesterday evening, the police said that he has been ""interdicted"", a technical term for suspended, since Dec 27, 2018.
 All of the affected inquiries were earlier handled by then State Coroner Marvin Bay, and he had to look into the cases again.
 The six cases heard yesterday involved fatal traffic accidents. The inquiries into these cases had initially taken place between 2016 and 2018.
 The police added in their statement: ""After the re-hearings of the six (cases, Coroner Bay) was satisfied that there was no miscarriage of justice.""
 One of the cases involved deliveryman Tan Kiah Huat, who was riding a motorcycle shortly before he was involved in a traffic accident on Dec 21, 2016.
 A man was driving a lorry along Jalan Bukit Merah towards Alexandra Road that day when he felt an impact on the rear of his vehicle.
 Mr Tan was later found lying on the road and the police were notified at 3.25pm.
 The 62-year-old Singaporean was taken to Singapore General Hospital and he died of multiple injuries about an hour later.
 The court heard that Station Insp Cheong later prepared a statement purportedly from Mr Tan's sister, who cannot speak or hear.
 In the statement, she supposedly said that her brother was ""behaving normally"" before his death and that he had no suicidal tendencies.
 It turned out that the statement had been fabricated. A sign language interpreter later communicated with the woman and learnt that she could not recall being approached by Station Insp Cheong to give her statement.
 In the statement, she supposedly said that her brother was ""behaving normally"" before his death and that he had no suicidal tendencies. It turned out that the statement had been fabricated.    Coroner Bay said: ""Despite the fact of the conditioned statement of the next of kin being forged, (it concerned only) background information on Mr Tan's health and his absence of suicidal intent... I reconfirm my verdict of Mr Tan's demise from an unfortunate traffic misadventure.""
 Another case involved construction worker Mahamudul Islam Zia Md Sikat Ali, 36.
 On Jan 16, 2016, the Bangladeshi was seen running across Kitchener Road in Little India before a lorry knocked him down. He was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and he died of his injuries two days later.
 Yesterday, the court heard that Station Insp Cheong allegedly forged a statement from an eyewitness for this case.
 Investigations revealed that the content of this forged document was similar to that of an earlier written statement taken by another IO, who came from a team that dealt with non-fatal accidents.
 Station Insp Cheong is also said to have forged the statement of a man whose father died in a 2016 incident.
 The father, Mr Ismail Mohd Noh, was riding a bicycle near Bedok North Road on Aug 3 that year when a taxi knocked him down.
 He was taken to Changi General Hospital and he died of heart and lung injuries. The court heard that the son had never met Station Insp Cheong personally.

43,"Dubious sources cited by supporters of ivermectin for Covid-19
The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 20, 2021 Wednesday","From medical studies on the use of ivermectin to credible-sounding organisations, websites like Truth Warriors cite a variety of sources, including studies and organisations helmed by doctors.
 However, as The Straits Times has learnt, these sources and their claims are shrouded in controversy.
 One such claim that has gained tremendous international attention concerns the drug ivermectin, a medication used to treat parasitic infections.
 Proponents of the drug have claimed that it is effective in treating or preventing Covid-19.
 Ivermectin was created in the 1970s to treat parasites in livestock, but the drug gained new life as doctors looked at repurposing a plethora of existing drugs to see what might be effective against Covid-19.
 Advocacy groups and online communities have formed globally, such as the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance, cited by Truth Warriors as a source of credible information.
 The alliance began as a non-profit network of doctors trying to establish Covid-19 protocols in the early days of the pandemic, but has come under scrutiny for its affiliation with prominent anti-vaccine organisations.
 For instance, the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have put out advisories warning against using ivermectin as treatment for or prevention of Covid-19.
 Currently available data does not show its effectiveness and taking large doses of ivermectin is also dangerous, the FDA warned.
 Associate Professor Jenny Low, a senior consultant in infectious diseases from the Singapore General Hospital, said much of the controversy over ivermectin stems from the fact that its proponents have ignored the varying quality of trials testing it for Covid-19.
 She said: ""If we remove the 'noise' of poor-quality clinical trials and their reports, and just focus on the ones that are of at least decent quality, then the current evidence does not support the use of ivermectin.
 ""That's not to say that the drug definitely does not work.
 ""We can only say that with the best evidence out there to date, there is no strong evidence to support its use.""
 Studies involving ivermectin have also proven to be problematic.
 In July, a pre-print study on the efficacy and safety of ivermectin led by Dr Ahmed Elgazzar from Benha University in Egypt was retracted after serious ethical concerns were raised.
 It claimed to be a randomised control trial, but questions surrounding the credibility of the data surfaced.
 Last month, BuzzFeed News reported on an influential study from Argentina claiming ivermectin prevented Covid-19 all the time.
 But its data remained questionable and it was reported that there were signs that some of the experiments did not happen as claimed.
 Prof Low also noted that even the drug's manufacturer, Merck, has advised against the use of ivermectin for Covid-19.
 Pre-clinical doses that showed the drug to work in the laboratory also cannot be used on people as they are several hundred times higher than the doses recommended for humans, she added.
 Some of the doctors cited by websites like Truth Warriors, such as Dr Joseph Mercola, have been identified as some of the most influential spreaders of Covid-19 misinformation online.
 An osteopathic physician, he has long been a subject of criticism and government regulatory action for his promotion of unproven or unapproved treatments.
 In a warning letter in February, the FDA drew attention to various unapproved and misbranded products related to Covid-19 on Dr Mercola's website and social media sites.
 According to researchers, he has become the chief spreader of coronavirus misinformation online, The New York Times reported on Oct 6.
 The Truth Warriors also cited immunologist Byram Bridle in his claim that spike proteins created in response to mRNA vaccines are harmful to the body.
 Dr Bridle also speculated that Covid-19 shots could lead to cardiovascular problems and infertility.
 However, there is currently no such evidence to suggest that his claims are true.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 22, 2021 Friday","A bandage developed by scientists here can monitor infection and vital indicators about chronic wounds, with the information relayed to doctors to allow them to hold a consultation with patients remotely.
 The bandage is part of a point-of-care wound assessment platform called VeCare, which also includes an electronic chip and a mobile app.
 Created by a research team from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and clinical partners from Singapore General Hospital, the bandage's sensor technology is believed to be the first of its kind.
 The VeCare bandage is targeted at people with chronic wounds such as venous leg ulcers.
 It can detect temperature, pH, bacteria type and inflammatory factors specific to chronic wounds within 15 minutes, enabling fast and accurate assessment.
 The bandage assesses the wound's micro-environment as well as its infection and inflammation state through biomarkers from the wound's fluid using an electrochemical system.
 A chip connected to the sensor transmits data wirelessly to the mobile app for real-time wound assessment.
 This allows doctors to track the patient's healing progress and determine whether further treatment is needed.
 The VeCare bandage complements the patient's existing medical treatment while allowing medical intervention for wound healing processes to be more timely.
 The research team behind the bandage hopes that more patients can monitor their chronic wounds at home, thus reducing hospital visits.
 Professor Lim Chwee Teck, director of NUS Institute for Health Innovation and Technology, is the lead researcher for the project.
 He said: ""Currently, we assess wounds using visual inspection. But doctors can't tell if there's still infection in the wound (via visual inspection). That's why we decided to make this device to place directly on the wound so they can tell what the specific bacteria types are and the inflammatory factors.""
 The next stage of development for the VeCare bandage will involve clinical tests on about 50 to 100 patients spanning one to two years, before it is rolled out to other patients in around two years.",The Straits Times (Singapore),21-010-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.999996642456986}",en,0.999996642456986
45,"'Mr POSB' Bertie Cheng dies from Covid-19; son urges seniors to get vaccinated
Today (Singapore) - Online
October 22, 2021 Friday","SINGAPORE - Known by some as ""Mr POSB"", the former chief executive officer (CEO) of the bank Bertie Cheng Shao Shiong died on Friday morning (Oct 22) from Covid-19 at the age of 84.
He was not vaccinated against the coronavirus, his son Alvin Cheng, 44, told TODAY.
""My father was a kind and generous man, and he had enjoyed a good life,"" said Mr Cheng, who works as a retail assistant at a grocery store.
""We had tried very hard to convince him to get the vaccine for his own good, but he had been reluctant to do so,"" added the younger of two sons. ""He was just not keen on vaccines.""
The elder son, Mr Melvin Cheng, 46, said that their father was not against vaccines altogether, but had been waiting for vaccine technology to ""stabilise"" and for ""version two"" of the vaccines to emerge before going for the jab.
""He had indicated that he would like for vaccines to become more established before getting vaccinated,"" said the oldest son, who works in the finance sector. In the meantime, their father would only leave the home sparingly.
The family's worst fears were realised when Cheng, who had high blood pressure and diabetes, tested positive for Covid-19 late last month after developing a sore throat and cough.
He had been warded at National University Hospital for three weeks before his death at 1.45am on Friday.
The death certificate listed the coronavirus as a factor in his death.
Mr Alvin Cheng urged elderly Singaporeans who are still unvaccinated to get the jab as soon as they can for their own protection against the coronavirus.
""I count it as God's blessing that my father was able to pass away peacefully, instead of having to suffer at the intensive care unit,"" he said.
Cheng, who retired from POSBank in 1997 prior to its acquisition by DBS Group Holdings the following year, had served as POSB's CEO for 23 years. He had worked at the bank for more than three decades, when the Post Office Savings Bank - as it was then known - was still a statutory board under the Ministry of Communication, and later, the Ministry of Finance.
Under his leadership, POSB became the first bank to adopt computerisation, going digital in 1974. Cheng adopted the trademark key logo for the bank and pushed for the introduction of ATMs around the Republic in 1976, and was instrumental in building the bank's identity as a ""people's bank"".
In 2010, DBS chief executive officer Piyush Gupta invited Cheng to return to POSB as an advisor atÂ a time when the bank was losing customers to its rivals, partly due to long queues at ATM machines.
Mr Gupta had described Cheng as an ""iconic"" leader of the bank during its early years.
In response to TODAY's query, DBS said: ""All of us at DBS would like to express our deepest sympathies and heartfelt condolences to the family of Mr Bertie Cheng.""
Mr Peter Seah, DBS chairman, said: ""Bertie will be remembered as one of the pioneers that built Singapore and has created a key institution for past and future generations. He is truly Mr POSB and has shared his experience most generously with us. We in DBS owe him a big thank you.""
Calling Cheng a ""a good friend and colleague"" he has known for a long time, Mr Seah added: ""He will be missed for his friendship and wonderful sense of humour.""
Head of POSB Yeo Wenxian said Cheng was unwavering in his belief that being the 'people's bank' meant always doing the right thing by our customers and employees.
""His constant support, wise counsel, and big heart will be dearly missed by us all.""

Besides POSB, Cheng had served as a director of several listed companies, including Hong Leong Finance, engineering company TEE International, infocommunications firm TeleChoice International, Brunei bank Baiduri, and seafood firm Pacific Andes Resources Development.
He had previously served as a board member of NTUC Childcare Co-operative, as well as a chairman of the Medifund Committee of Singapore General Hospital and the vice-chairman of the Consumer Association of Singapore Endowment Fund.
Cheng was a recipient of the Public Administration Medal (Silver) in 1984 and the Public Service Medal in 2001. In 2008, Cheng also received the Friend of Labour Award from the labour movement.

46,"Still risk of healthcare system reaching tipping point; While pressure is great, experts say current curbs provide time for more to be vaccinated
The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 23, 2021 Saturday","Six months ago, Indian hospitals turned away Covid-19 patients and pleaded for oxygen as supplies ran desperately low.
 A year before that, exhausted Italian doctors were forced to choose who to save among the many who needed intensive care.
 These scenes have played out in hospitals all over the world, whenever a new wave of infections threatens to swamp a country's healthcare system.
 Singapore's healthcare system is world-class. But now it, too, is being stretched to its limit. On Wednesday, the multi-ministerial task force tackling the pandemic said Covid-19 restrictions will be extended until Nov 21, as the system faces a ""considerable risk of... being overwhelmed"".
 Already, hospitals have postponed follow-up visits and elective operations to accommodate the rising number of Covid-19 patients, creating a backlog that will take months to clear. How close is Singapore's healthcare system to its breaking point'
 Singapore has chosen to maintain its stance rather than reverting to stricter measures, and that is one indication of where the country stands, said Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.
 ""I would say the healthcare system is under pressure,"" he added. ""But we are not at the stage where our doctors have to make hard decisions on ring-fencing hospital resources for some patients, and to give up on other patients.""
 Professor Paul Tambyah, a senior consultant at the National University Hospital's (NUH) infectious diseases division, said that public hospitals in Singapore have relatively high bed occupancy rates compared with other high-income countries.
 In a way, this means doctors are ""used to"" making hard decisions about which patients can afford to wait, he said. ""Most clinicians are taking the current surge in our stride, although it is challenging.""
 Even so, the pressure is great. A commentary published last December in the Annals - the official journal of Singapore's Academy of Medicine - sheds some light on what local hospitals face.
 The Singapore General Hospital is the country's largest. It has 58 intensive care unit (ICU) beds in peacetime, although this can be increased to 120 beds if the need arises, the paper's authors observed.
 To do so, critically ill patients would have to be warded in high-dependency units, operating rooms and post-anaesthesia care units. Elective operations would have to be postponed.
 The authors added that the lack of skilled manpower is the ""main bottleneck"" for ICUs, where hospitals tend to maintain a very high 1:1 nurse to patient ratio.
 ""Staffing for ICUs has traditionally been labour-intensive and this baseline shortage is compounded by the prolonged training required to achieve competency,"" they wrote.
 Although the number of Covid-19 patients who need critical care forms a tiny proportion of all cases, the demands they make on the hospital system are disproportionately large.
 In July, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said Singapore can open 1,000 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. It was an ambitious target: Two months later, there were only around 100 such beds.
 Now, it still has fewer than 300 ICU beds. To ramp up capacity to the 300-bed mark, the country will have to stomach ""further degradation of normal service"".
 Singapore has 1,650 isolation beds for Covid-19 patients, 89 per cent of which were full as at Wednesday. It also has 200 dedicated ICU beds, which were taken up by 71 people on ventilators and another 75 who were admitted for closer monitoring.
 This is why the extension of Covid-19 measures has been deemed necessary, especially since the number of new cases shows no sign of falling yet.
 As Prof Teo put it: Each additional week that the rules are in place means more people getting booster shots or natural infections, giving them immunity against the virus and preventing numbers from shooting up when the rules are relaxed.
 It also gives front-line healthcare workers - who have been fighting this battle for nearly two years - a chance at a respite. Healthcare workers will be rostered for leave towards the end of this year, and have been given the green light to travel to countries with which Singapore has Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) arrangements.
 At the same time, each additional week of restrictions means money lost for businesses, and further dents the morale of a population that is chafing under rules that seem to have no clear end in sight.
 It has been emphasised that Singapore's current position is different from that of other developed countries, where infection ran rampant and lives were lost before vaccination became widespread.
 Here, infections in the wider community were kept low. This is the first major wave that the country is experiencing, and vaccination has not quite managed to prevent the spread of the virus, even though it stops severe illness.
 But knowing this context does not make it any easier when one sees people in many other developed countries going about life as usual, with masks - the most visible symbol of the pandemic - noticeably absent in outdoor spaces.
 Could there be a middle-of-the-road solution? Professor Dale Fisher, also a senior consultant at NUH's infectious diseases division, believes so. The differentiated policies for unvaccinated people, which are already in place, could enable more opening-up, he suggested.
  NOT AT BREAKING POINT I would say the healthcare system is under pressure... But we are not at the stage where our doctors have to make hard decisions on ring-fencing hospital resources for some patients, and to give up on other patients.
 PROFESSOR TEO YIK YING,  dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.  If people who are not vaccinated are not allowed to join large groups in malls and hawker centres, fewer will fall ill and require ICU care. This means those who are vaccinated can be afforded more freedom.
 Singapore could also consider other easing measures, such as establishing more VTLs with other countries or even removing outdoor mask rules, Prof Fisher said.
  MANPOWER CONSTRAINTS Staffing for ICUs has traditionally been labour-intensive and this baseline shortage is compounded by the prolonged training required to achieve competency.
  ''
 THE AUTHORS OF A COMMENTARY PUBLISHED LAST DECEMBER IN THE ANNALS,
  on the lack of skilled manpower being the ""main bottleneck"" for intensive care units.  He suggested that curbs could focus on large indoor gatherings and other such indoor settings, while allowing more freedom outdoors.
 This is unlikely to lead to a big spike in infections but it would benefit people. ""People should be allowed to walk their dogs without a mask,"" said Prof Fisher
 In other words, more elbow room for vaccinated people - who tend not to fall too ill - is not likely to lead to a rise in hospitalisations. Already, nearly three-quarters of infected people recover at home, and facilities have been set up outside hospitals to care for those who need closer watching.
 It is a very fine balance that is difficult to get right.
 But Singapore cannot stay in this limbo forever, and the solution cannot simply be more VTLs because Singaporeans need more than a temporary reprieve.
 What is needed is a concrete step forward - a move that impacts day-to-day life and reintroduces a sense of normalcy. Singapore may have to start small, but it has to start moving.

47,"When inquiries are affected by fake statements; A police investigation officer allegedly forged multiple statements linked to eight coroner's inquiries between 2016 and 2018, forcing the coroner to reopen the cases. Court Correspondent Shaffiq Alkhatib looks at seven of the cases, while the remaining one is pending.
The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 24, 2021 Sunday","DRUNK MOTORCYCLIST  Security officer Tan Choon Lai, 56, was believed to be intoxicated when he rode his motorcycle in a slip road of the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) into Bukit Timah Expressway shortly after midnight on July 10, 2017.
 His motorcycle crashed into the left side of a taxi before hitting a guard railing.
 The Singaporean, who suffered multiple injuries, was taken to the National University Hospital and died at around 3am.
 Station Inspector Kenny Cheong Chyuan Lih allegedly forged four statements - two from the taxi driver and one each from a witness and Mr Tan's sister.
 During hearings into the reopened cases that took place last week, Coroner Marvin Bay said that while the sources of the forged contents were unclear, Station Insp Cheong had told investigators that all the statements were forged following verbal conversations with the subjects.
 Delivering his findings last Monday, Coroner Bay said Mr Tan had a grossly elevated post-mortem blood alcohol level of 233mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood.
 This is almost three times the legal limit of 80mg.
 The coroner said: ""(This) would have likely caused severe intoxication, such as drowsiness, loss of coordination or poor judgment.
 ""It is probable that in his intoxicated state and impairment of his faculties, (Mr Tan) had either lost control of his motorcycle or inattentively swerved his vehicle onto (the taxi), and then swerved right before colliding into the guard railing.
 The coroner found Mr Tan's death to be a traffic misadventure.
 In a statement last Monday, the police said Station Inspector Kenny Cheong Chyuan Lih has since been suspended and they were unable to comment further as investigations were ongoing.  HIT-AND-RUN  On Aug 11, 2015, at around 6am, Mr Tan Ser Chuan, 57, a Malaysian, was riding his motorcycle along Ayer-Rajah Expressway towards Marina Coastal Expressway when he skidded and fell.
 A taxi ran over him and drove off. The cabby went to his company's servicing centre but did not make any repairs there. He later drove to a private repair shop in Eunos.
 An eyewitness alerted the police and a paramedic pronounced Mr Tan dead at the scene at 6.20am. He was later found to have died of blunt force trauma to his head and chest.
 The cabby was caught after investigators viewed expressway camera footage of the incident.
 The taxi was seen making an abrupt swerve to the left when it reached the spot where Mr Tan and his motorcycle were lying.
 The court heard that the front headlamps of the taxi were then seen jerking up and down, suggesting that the vehicle had run over something.
 The cabby was sentenced to five months' jail, fined $1,000 and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for three years.
 Station Insp Cheong had allegedly forged statements from the cabby and Mr Tan's daughter.
 Coroner Bay said last Monday that subsequent investigations showed the forged documents were adapted from other statements recorded from the pair. He found Mr Tan's death to be an unfortunate traffic misadventure.
  DRUNK DRIVER  Mr Tan Hock Hai, 40, had consumed alcoholic drinks shortly before he drove his car along the PIE on Nov 2, 2016.
 He lost control of his vehicle and crashed into some guard railings.
 He suffered multiple injuries including a severed left arm and was pronounced dead at the scene at around 2am.
 Last Monday, Coroner Bay said Mr Tan was found to have a blood alcohol level of 271mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood - more than triple the limit of 80mg.
 Station Insp Cheong allegedly forged a statement from Mr Tan's wife. Coroner Bay said that in the fabricated statement, she stated that Mr Tan would meet clients or friends, at least once a week after work, in the Jurong area. And she purportedly believed the collision had occurred while Mr Tan was on his way home after meeting his clients or friends.
 This fake statement added that she had on a few occasions detected the presence of alcohol in Mr Tan's breath, after he had driven home.
 When the Internal Affairs Office of the Singapore Police Force interviewed her, she did not recall Senior Insp Cheong asking her to sign any statements.
 The coroner noted that the policeman said the contents of this forged document were based on verbal conversations.
 Coroner Bay found Mr Tan's death to be a traffic misadventure.
  LORRY COLLISION  Deliveryman Tan Kiah Huat, 62, was riding a motorcycle shortly before he was involved in a traffic accident on Dec 21, 2016.
 A man was driving a lorry in Jalan Bukit Merah towards Alexandra Road that day when he felt an impact on the rear of his vehicle.
 Mr Tan, a Singaporean, was found lying on the road and the police were notified at 3.25pm. He was taken to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and died of multiple injuries about an hour later.
 Station Insp Cheong allegedly prepared a statement purportedly from Mr Tan's sister, who cannot speak or hear. In the statement, she supposedly said her brother had been behaving normally before his death and he had no suicidal tendencies.
 It turned out that the statement had been fabricated.
 A sign language interpreter later communicated with the woman and learnt that she could not recall being approached by Station Insp Cheong to give her statement.
 Coroner Bay said last Monday that it was uncertain what source material the policeman had referred to in the document.
 He added: ""Despite the fact of the conditioned statement of the next of kin being forged, (it concerned only) background information on Mr Tan's health and his absence of suicidal intent... I reconfirm my verdict of Mr Tan's demise from an unfortunate traffic misadventure.""
  KNOCKED DOWN BY LORRY  On Jan 16, 2016, Bangladeshi construction worker Mahamudul Islam Zia Md Sikat Ali, 36, was seen running across Kitchener Road in Little India before a lorry knocked him down. He was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and died of his injuries two days later.
 Last Monday, the court heard that Station Insp Cheong allegedly forged a statement from an eyewitness for this case. Investigations revealed that the contents of this forged document were similar to that of an earlier written statement taken by another investigation officer, who came from a team that dealt with non-fatal accidents.
 Coroner Bay said the other investigation officer had not been aware of Mr Mahamudul's death at the time she recorded the statement from the witness. She had been required by existing protocol to hand the case over to Station Insp Cheong when Mr Mahamudul died.
 Mr Bay reconfirmed his verdict that Mr Mahamudul's death was an unfortunate traffic misadventure.
  CYCLIST HIT BY TAXI  Mr Ismail Mohd Noh was riding a bicycle near Bedok North Road on Aug 3, 2016, when a taxi knocked him down.
 He was taken to Changi General Hospital and died of heart and lung injuries later that morning.
 Station Insp Cheong allegedly forged a statement from Mr Ismail's son. The son recalled talking to the policeman only over the phone and had never met him.
 Coroner Bay noted last Monday that the son said he had never been asked to sign a conditioned statement. Mr Bay reconfirmed that Mr Ismail's death was an unfortunate traffic misadventure.
  HIT WHILE CROSSING ROAD  Singaporean security officer Shaik Shamshudin E.K. Shaik Hussain, 59, was crossing the road near the junction of Victoria Street and Arab Street on Dec 29, 2015, when a taxi hit him.
 He was taken to SGH and died of multiple injuries two days later.
 Station Insp Cheong allegedly forged three statements - one each from the taxi driver, an eyewitness and Mr Shaik's daughter.
 Last Tuesday, Coroner Bay found Mr Shaik's death to be an unfortunate traffic misadventure.
 He also said the contents of the forged documents linked to the driver and the eyewitness were found to be similar to earlier statements taken by another investigation officer.

48,"New fatwa on wearing of tudung for healthcare staff says they must still prioritise personal, workplace safety
Today (Singapore) - Online
October 26, 2021 Tuesday","SINGAPORE - Singapore's Islamic Religious Council (Muis) on Tuesday (Oct 26) issued a new fatwa - or religious guidance - on the wearing of tudung, or headscarf, for women who work in the public healthcare sector and other uniformed officers within the public service.
Muis said in a statement that although there is a religious duty for Muslim women to wear a tudung, the fatwa recognises that there could be other ""legitimate factors and considerations that are of more critical importance"".
""This should be considered when choosing to make adjustments to the way religious obligations are observed in the workplace,"" it added.Â 
As such, a Fatwa Committee - a body under Muis that issues religious edicts to help Muslims here navigate modern society according to Islamic principles - advised that healthcare professionals, especially those in high-risk settings, must prioritise personal and workplace safety.
For example, this would include reducing the risk of infection by observing the ""bare below elbow"" policy, which requires some healthcare workers not to wear long sleeves, and the replacement of tudung in certain clinical contexts.
For other uniformed services such as the police force, where uniform policies have not changed,Â the Fatwa Committee said that there are legitimate considerations for Muslim women to continue with their work in those services, even if they cannot put on the tudung when working.
These considerations are the need to secure a stable and meaningful livelihood for oneself or one's dependants, or both, and contributing to the well-being, stability and prosperity of the country.
Â ""It is also important to ensure that Muslim women who can wear the tudung, if the uniform policies permit, should do so on their own volition and without any form of coercion,"" Muis said.
From Nov 1, Muslim staff members working in the public healthcare sector,Â including nurses, will be allowed to wear a tudung at work if they choose to do so, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Aug 29 during theÂ National Day Rally.
CUSTOMISED HEADSCARVES
When asked how SingHealth intends to implement the tudung policy from Nov 1, Adjunct Associate Professor Tracy Carol Ayre, group chief nurse of the public healthcare group, said that its staff members are permitted to wear the tudung so long as the headscarf meets its guidelines on design, material and colour.
The group has produced tudungs meant for healthcare workers, featuring slits for surgical masks and stethoscopes, and they are made of light and moisture-wicking materials. These may be bought from stores within SingHealth institutions.
Staff members have a choice of three colours - white, light grey and dark grey, Adj Assoc Prof Ayre said. She chairs the group's implementation working committee that guides policies to support SingHealth's Muslim workers.
However, employees in high-risk clinical settings such as operating theatres, where a higher level of cleanliness and sterility is mandated, will not be allowed to wear a tudung.
""Staff are to continue with the use of the single-use disposable caps, where relevant, according to the prevailing infection prevention and control guidelines,"" Adj Assoc Prof Ayre said, adding that disposable tudungs are still being considered.

In response to TODAY's queries, National Healthcare Group, group chief human resource officer Olivia Tay said on Wednesday that staff may wear a plain black, navy blue or white tudung, based on feedback from staff on their preference.
She said that the material for the tudung, such as light and dri-fit material for non-air conditioned settings, should be suitable for staff to fully carry out their work.
She added that the material of tudung should not compromise the safe wearing of surgical or N95 masks.
When an N95 mask is to be worn with the tudung, all staff wearing it must be re-fitted without any extenders or modifications to N95 masks with the tudung on, to ensure that a proper seal is achieved, she said.
""Staff working in certain high risk settings may also be required to comply with specific infection control guidelines for the relevant setting when wearing the tudung,"" said Ms Tay.
IHH Healthcare Singapore told TODAY that â€‹â€‹staff can purchase the approved tudungs from its uniform vendor, or use their personal tudung, provided it is similar to the approved tudung in terms of style, colour and fabric.
In response to TODAY's queries, Raffles Medical Group said that it supports the tudung policy and is ""evaluating the scope and guiding principles to ensure patient care standards and infection control prevention, occupational safety and health of our employees"".
""We will take guidance from the public healthcare sector in reviewing our uniform policy as needed before full implementation.""

The discussion on whether Muslim nurses will be allowed to wear the tudung while at work had been anÂ ongoing one.
Following the announcement by Mr Lee in August, Muis received requests for guidance on the specifics of this religious obligation, both for nurses in situations where they might be unable to fully comply with the religious requirement due to operational reasons, as well as for other uniformed services where tudung is not allowed, it said.
It then conducted engagement sessions with the Ministry of Health, healthcare institutions and workers, and various other stakeholders before formulating the fatwa.
NEED TO EDUCATE COMMUNITY WELL
Speaking at an engagement session on Tuesday, which involved individuals from the healthcare sector, Malay Muslim organisations, online influencers and members of the media, Mufti Nazirudin Mohd Nasir who is theÂ highest Islamic authorityÂ hereÂ said: ""For the officers involved... This has been a very distressing problem.
""When there is a lack of guidance, some may feel that the faith is compromisedÂ and they become less of a Muslim when they adjust. In fact, this could lead to the blaming and guilting of Muslims for choosing jobs or placing themselves in situations where their faith cannot be fully practised.""
Dr Juriyah Yatim, assistant director for nursing at the Singapore General Hospital, expressed concern during the session that within the healthcare community itself, Muslims might pressure their female Muslim colleagues to wear the tudung now that it is allowed.
Dr Nazirudin said that beyond healthcare professionals, patients might pass remarks or make comments.
""That's a very delicate situation and I understand and I trust that the healthcare institutions will also protect their employees... And this is precisely why we need to educate our community well,"" he added.
Dr Juriyah said that the new implementation will entice more youthÂ to join the healthcare sector, having witnessed workers leave their roles previously because they were not to permitted to wear the tudung.
""With this movement in public healthcare institutions, this is very much welcomed... We're hopeful.""
The Singapore Muslim Women's Association, or Persatuan Pemudi Islam Singapura (PPIS), told TODAY that it has been actively taking part in discussions on the tudung issue and appreciates the Fatwa Committee's efforts to issue the religious guidance.
""As the fatwa is not prescriptive but contains guiding principles, it is important to highlight the intent of the fatwa so it is not misunderstood,"" it added.
""PPIS hopes the fatwa reassures Muslim women and their families by serving as a guide, so women can make balanced and informed decisions for themselves and their own unique situations.""",Today (Singapore) - Online,27-010-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999986867903962}",en,0.9999986867903962
49,"Couple convicted over hindering Covid-19 contact tracing
The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 27, 2021 Wednesday","A married couple from China were convicted yesterday of offences including hindering health officers from carrying out their duties after the husband tested positive for Covid-19 last year.
 Following a joint trial, District Judge Ng Peng Hong found the wife, Shi Sha, now 38, guilty of four charges under the Infectious Diseases Act.
 In January last year, she deliberately withheld information when a health officer asked her about the whereabouts and activities of her husband Hu Jun, now 40.
 The following month, she committed offences including lying to a health officer.
 Hu was convicted of one charge under the Act after he deliberately withheld information when a health officer asked him about his whereabouts and activities.
 The couple were the first two people to be charged under the Act in relation to the current pandemic. Shi was living in Singapore when her husband flew in from Wuhan, which was the epicentre of Covid-19 at the time.
 In an earlier statement, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said Hu arrived in Singapore on Jan 22 last year, and was confirmed to be infected with the virus nine days later. He was discharged from hospital on Feb 19 after recovering.
 Shi was identified as a close contact and issued a quarantine order on Feb 1, after MOH initiated contact tracing to identify those who may have been exposed to Hu.
 During the trial last year, epidemiologist Yang Yong testified that Hu had said he stayed in his friend's apartment near the couple's home in Nathan Road between Jan 23 and Jan 29 after developing symptoms such as a fever.
 Senior public health officer Georgina Lim testified that Shi had told her she was in isolation at home with her husband.
 But records provided by the Land Transport Authority show that Shi had booked rides from Grab to several locations during that period, said Ms Lim.
 The records also show that she booked a Grab ride from Studio M Hotel in Robertson Quay to the Singapore General Hospital on Jan 29.
 Ms Lim testified that this was contrary to what Shi had told her - that she had flagged down ""a blue taxi"" outside their home to take her husband to the hospital that day.
 Hu and Shi, who were offered bail of $10,000 each yesterday, are expected to be sentenced on Nov 10.
 For each charge under the Act, a first-time offender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000.
 A repeat offender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.",The Straits Times (Singapore),26-010-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999964200025837}",en,0.9999964200025837
50,"Get tested for hearing problems at 3 community clinics
The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 27, 2021 Wednesday","People with hearing issues can get tested at three community clinics instead of in hospitals, in a pilot scheme made possible by a new device.
 The new set-ups at Pioneer Polyclinic, Tiong Bahru Community Health Centre and the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Sleep Centre in Outram come amid statistics showing that many people may be suffering from hearing loss.
 According to Project Silver Screen, Singapore's nationwide health screening regime for the elderly, an estimated 320,000 seniors experience significant hearing loss.
 These clinics make it more convenient for people to seek help from an audiologist as they require only a referral from a general practitioner.
 Currently, those who are referred to the hospitals have to undergo a test before being assigned to an audiologist for a separate appointment.
 The device at the heart of the pilot was created by a multi-disciplinary team from the National University Health System, SGH and the National University of Singapore (NUS) for the Ministry of Health's National Innovation Challenge on Active and Confident Ageing.
 It functions via a combination of in-ear testing equipment, mufflers for noise insulation and an audiometer for measurement of hearing loss.
 Before testing, an iOS app will be used to ensure ambient noise is at a non-obstructive level for test accuracy.
 With this new set-up, physicians can conduct hearing evaluations within spaces that are not sound-insulated.
 Previously, testing for hearing loss had to be conducted in soundproofed rooms in hospitals that cost up to $60,000 to retrofit.
 The new testing method was first used in Pioneer Polyclinic in August last year, before being introduced in Tiong Bahru Community Health Centre in January and SGH in July.
 Professor William Hal Martin from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, who led the development of the new device, said: ""Seniors might avoid seeking hearing-related care due to cultural prejudices against accepting hearing loss, and the inconvenience of seeking care through the system.
 ""However, the hope is that with the enhanced cost-effectiveness and portability of these new devices, we will be able to make hearing care more accessible.""
 The community hearing clinics are in line with the shifting emphasis away from hospital care.
 Mr Gopal Krishna Sarepaka, senior manager and principal audiologist at SGH's Ear, Nose and Throat Centre, said: ""Having these hearing clinics in the community not only offers greater convenience for the elderly, but also frees up resources for hospitals to focus on patients with more complex hearing issues.""
 The team envisions a roll-out of the technology islandwide by different healthcare providers.
 Madam Vera Wee, 60, who works part-time in sales and experienced hearing loss for 10 years before getting treated at Pioneer Polyclinic, said: ""I only had to get tested and measured for my hearing aid, before I collected it about two months later.
 ""It's very convenient.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),26-010-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999980447844692}",en,0.9999980447844692
51,"Healthcare workers at emergency departments also feel strain
The Straits Times (Singapore)
October 31, 2021 Sunday","As healthcare workers in intensive care units (ICU) of hospitals grapple with the latest wave of Covid-19 cases, their counterparts tending to such patients in emergency departments (EDs) are also feeling the strain.
 Doctors and nurses said they have been noticing more people turning up at EDs with mild Covid-19 symptoms after a positive antigen rapid test (ART).
 Registered nurse Melissa (not her real name), who works in the ED at a public hospital, estimated 75 per cent of ED walk-ins have been Covid-19-related cases since late August.
 ""Before that, about 50 per cent at the ED were Covid-19 cases. Now, more people are streaming in because they are paranoid and fearful, despite having no or mild symptoms,"" she told The Sunday Times.
 On Oct 27, 5,324 new infections were reported locally, the first time the daily case number breached the 5,000 mark since cases spiked in late August.
 Like Melissa, healthcare workers ST spoke to declined to reveal their names and, in some cases, their hospital because of work policies.
 Around half of those who sought treatment at the ED after testing positive were eligible for the Covid-19 home recovery programme (HRP), said Melissa.
 ""They were fully vaccinated and had mild symptoms. They wanted to be admitted because they were afraid, but we did not have the capacity to take care of them.""
 The HRP has been the default care arrangement for everyone, except certain groups, since Oct 10.
 Partially or unvaccinated individuals aged 50 and older, vaccinated people aged 80 and older, and children below one year old are excluded from this arrangement.
 Doctors have also noticed the rise in paranoia in Covid-19 patients.
 ""There is a marked increase in anxiety among people due to the rising case count,"" said Dr James, as he recalled seeing a patient with mild symptoms who insisted on being admitted to the hospital. ""It seems like the number of people calling 995 has also doubled.
 ""This has resulted in a manpower crunch where one medical officer often has to take on the workload of two to three people.""
 The Ministry of Health and the Singapore Civil Defence Force on Oct 25 urged the public not to dial 995 for non-emergency cases, including those with Covid-19.
 They said almost half of Covid-19 patients who called for emergency medical services (EMS) recently did not require urgent treatment.
 Dr Loh, who works at the ED of another hospital, said patients with mild symptoms who turn up at hospitals out of fear present EDs with a difficult choice.
 ""In general, we are unable to turn patients away as they may come back in a worse condition without appropriate medical care.
 ""Hospital bed occupancy rates regularly exceed 100 per cent. Newly admitted patients will have to wait in temporary beds for up to 48 hours.""
 The manpower crunch has led to some healthcare workers from non-Covid-19 wards being deployed to Covid-19 wards.
 Julia, an enrolled nurse at Singapore General Hospital (SGH), said she was one of 16 nurses deployed from an orthopaedic ward to a Covid-19 general ward in August after a day's training.
 In response to queries, a spokesman for SGH said: ""As all SGH nurses are trained in infection prevention and control, those deployed to a Covid-19 ward will undergo a one-day orientation to familiarise themselves with the new work environment.""
 Julia said: ""Being a healthcare worker isn't easy. But all of us here know we are in the same boat. We're pushing on and trying our best to get Singapore through this pandemic.""
 Said Dr James: ""People need to learn the difference between ailments that can be treated at home and severe symptoms as it will ease the load on healthcare workers.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),30-010-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999971071559528}",en,0.9999971071559528

The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 1, 2021 Monday","Muslim nurses, allowed to wear the tudung to work from today, may use their own headscarves if they follow guidelines set by their organisations, said hospitals.
 The National Healthcare Group's group chief human resource officer, Mrs Olivia Tay, told The Straits Times that the group's nurses will be allowed to wear any suitable black, navy blue or white tudung.
 The headscarf should also not compromise the proper usage of an N95 surgical mask.
 ""When an N95 mask is to be worn with the tudung, all staff wearing it must be refitted without any extenders or modifications to the masks with the tudung on, to ensure that a proper seal is achieved,"" Mrs Tay said.
 The National University Health System (NUHS) said its nurses are not allowed to have any embellishments on their headscarves, and they are encouraged to use those made of breathable or sweat-wicking material if working in non-air-conditioned settings.
 Hospitals also said the headscarf will not be allowed in high-risk settings that require more stringent levels of cleanliness, such as operating theatres.
 SingHealth's group chief nurse, Adjunct Associate Professor Tracy Carol Ayre, said: ""Staff are to continue with the use of the single-use disposable caps, where relevant, according to the prevailing infection prevention and control guidelines.""
 However, she noted that the use of disposable tudung is being considered and more details would be provided at a later date.
 SingHealth has also come up with its own tudung, sporting special design features, which nurses may use if they prefer.
 Prof Ayre said an implementation working committee, in consultation with the Ministry of Health, has offered headscarves made of moisture-wicking fabric to keep users cool, and which also come with slits in place for surgical masks and stethoscopes.
 The SingHealth group includes Singapore General Hospital and KK Women's and Children's Hospital.
 ""Extensive discussion and research also went into the design and material to ensure that the tudung offered are safe, convenient and comfortable for our staff,"" she said.
 Staff can purchase the headscarves if they do not wish to use their own.
 Nurses are excited about the change in policy, first announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the National Day Rally in August.
 Ms Noormala Abdul Hamid has been in the nursing sector for 21 years. Although she started wearing the tudung in her daily life 15 years ago, she was not able to do the same at work.
 The 43-year-old said she would definitely be wearing the tudung now. ""Wearing a tudung does not compromise the quality of care I provide to my patients. This is a great move that I deeply appreciate,"" said the assistant nurse clinician.
 Ms Noormala conducts home visits for patients with chronic diseases who are discharged from Khoo Teck Puat Hospital or Yishun Community Hospital.
 She said her Muslim colleagues are equally happy about the move, which they said was progressive.
 ""We even talked about what colour to wear as a department, even though we have a few options from the hospital. I can feel their excitement,"" the mother of two said.
 Ms Noormala said she hopes more women who held back because of the policy against the tudung would want to join the healthcare sector after this.
 ""Hopefully this move will encourage more Muslim women to join the healthcare industry, especially at a time like this when it is so essential,"" she added.",The Straits Times (Singapore),31-010-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.999994852591888}",en,0.999994852591888

The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 6, 2021 Saturday","In the future, how cyclists and motorists react to one another on the road could be analysed with data from cameras and sensors to help develop transport policies.
 Using secure wireless networks, the movements of Covid-19 patients in hospitals could also be better tracked.
 These are some of the projects announced under two new research initiatives worth $174 million over five years that could further propel Singapore's digitalisation drive.
 One involves a research laboratory by United States technology company Cisco and the National University of Singapore (NUS), with an investment of $54 million.
 The other initiative links up tech, defence and engineering company ST Engineering with four partners and has a $120 million investment.
 Speaking at the launch of the Cisco-NUS lab yesterday, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said: ""Partnerships between companies continue to be an effective way to spur innovation and reimagine new business models.""
 The new Accelerated Digital Economy Corporate Laboratory will boost research into artificial intelligence, healthcare, cyber security, urban infrastructure and workplace productivity.
 Supported by the National Research Foundation, it aims to develop 17 tech solutions as well as 12 products and services.
 Mr Gan said these cutting-edge technologies can be accessed by companies looking to digitally transform their businesses.
 This is in line with Singapore's $25 billion Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 Plan, he said. The lab - in NUS' Kent Ridge campus - will create more than 20 research and development jobs, as well as training opportunities for almost 100 researchers, analysts, engineers and students.
 It is expected to partner at least 100 Singapore-based companies to customise and refine solutions according to their requirements.
 In healthcare, the lab is working with Singapore General Hospital to look into collecting and analysing the data of patients over secure wireless networks.
 This could, for instance, be used to monitor Covid-19 patients in the emergency department with radio-frequency identification tags. If they enter areas they are not supposed to, healthcare workers can quickly locate them and see who they came into close contact with.
 For urban infrastructure, the lab aims to simulate and analyse road traffic. Besides making sense of road users' interactions, data processed by network devices installed at lamp posts could also help researchers understand how cyclists and pedestrians behave towards one another on pavements.
 On Oct 28, ST Engineering announced that it is working with NUS, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore University of Technology and Design, and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research to speed up the commercialisation of tech research via industry applications.
 Dubbed Research Translation @ ST Engineering, the initiative will look into areas such as smart traffic management, 5G mobile, energy tech and cyber security. The partnership will involve up to 100 researchers and about 200 ST Engineering scientists and engineers.
 The outcomes of the research will be adopted by ST Engineering for its commercial and defence businesses in the aerospace, smart city and public security areas.",The Straits Times (Singapore),5-011-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.999996703441244}",en,0.999996703441244
54,"'I'm a perpetual optimist'; Dr Tan See Leng entered politics after 30 years as a GP and in the corporate world. The Manpower Minister tells Executive Editor Sumiko Tan how his private sector background gives him an 'outside the system' perspective
The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 7, 2021 Sunday","Up until eight years ago, Dr Tan See Leng was overweight, tipping the scales at 128kg at one point.
 Even for someone tall - he's 1.8m - he was, in his own words, ""really big"".
 To prove it, he reaches for his phone, scrolls through the photos and shows me a picture of himself looking very plump indeed.
 I can't help but laugh, which he does, too.
 I'm meeting the Manpower Minister for lunch at Rendezvous Restaurant.
 The restaurant at The Central in Clarke Quay is famous for its delicious but calorie-laden nasi padang. We order chicken rendang, mutton curry, sambal goreng, a cabbage dish, soup, and chendol for dessert.
 ""It's sinful but it's good,"" says Dr Tan, 56, as he helps heap food onto my plate at the interview in mid-September, before Covid-19 stabilisation phase measures kicked in. ""You don't eat this every day.""
 Are you a big foodie, I ask. ""Yes, I am,"" he says, readily.
 I remark that I've not seen food-related posts on his Instagram account, which is when he decides to show me his old photo.
 His weight now hovers around 92kg. He lost 30kg over two years, by walking more and cutting back on calories. ""Usually about 1.5kg or 2kg a month,"" he says. ""It's more sustainable when you do it gradually.""
 Lunch with the general practitioner (GP) turned corporate honcho turned politician is a relaxing, enjoyable affair.
 He has a calm, pleasant manner punctuated by self-deprecating humour. At one point, he says about being a politician: ""You need to be able to laugh at yourself.
 People say I'm an 'uncle'. So what if I've got a few more wrinkles'
 That's what makes us human and defines us, right'""
 His voice is soothing and you can imagine him putting a nervous patient at ease. Being still new to politics, he is also refreshingly candid and his quotes are almost free of jargon.
 The former chief executive of listed hospital group IHH Healthcare entered politics at the general election in July last year. At 55, he was the oldest of the new candidates on the People's Action Party's slate.
 He was made Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Manpower and for Trade and Industry after winning the Marine Parade GRC ward, and led efforts to contain the Covid-19 situation in foreign worker dormitories.
 In May this year, he became Minister for Manpower and retained his Trade and Industry portfolio. His plate is full dealing with issues like foreign talent, the welfare of lower-wage workers, retirement age, and rising energy prices.
 It's been a steep learning curve and he's still feeling his way, getting used not just to how the civil service works but also the rhythm of the Cabinet and the rigours of parliamentary debate.
 He usually eats lunch at his desk because his days are ""intense"". Do you regret entering politics, I ask.
 He laughs and repeats: ""I guess I didn't expect it to be so intense."" But you did enter politics during an especially trying period, I point out.
 ""I guess so. I also think that when you are from the private sector all your life, right, you are used to a different rigour.""
 For one thing, he has discovered how it can take a long time before the impact of a policy is felt.
 ""In the private sector, the reckoning comes every quarter. For policies, sometimes you don't see the effect until years later. You need to let them run.""
 In the meantime, policymakers must convince the electorate of the soundness of their plan.
 Communicating an idea to the population at large requires a different skill from convincing a small group, he has realised.
 ""If you are not able to translate the thoughts that are locked up in your brain to people on the ground, then that will be the bottleneck in how effective your policy is going to be.""
  LONELY CHILDHOOD  Becoming a minister was an unexpected detour in his career.
 As he puts it: ""I guess the thing about life is you never know what is going to happen next week. Like Forrest Gump said, life is like a box of chocolates.""
 He grew up in a rental flat in Toa Payoh, an only child. His father was a bus timekeeper and his mother sold Tupperware, gave tuition and baked cookies to sell at Chinese New Year. ""She was quite innovative so maybe I got the entrepreneur part from her.""
 He remembers a lonely childhood spent daydreaming and reading storybooks. While his parents worked, he was fostered out to a nanny during the week. She lived in a shophouse in Sam Leong Road in Little India.
 On weekends, he returned to his parents in Toa Payoh. He was close to his mother, who had rheumatoid arthritis and was always sickly and on medication, and would accompany her to the Singapore General Hospital for treatment.
 He studied at Monk's Hill Primary School, then Monk's Hill Secondary School in Newton. A fond memory is taking a bus from his school to the old National Library on Saturdays after ECA, or extra-curricular activity, and eating Indian rojak at a stall near there.
 He received a Promsho scholarship to study the humanities at Hwa Chong Junior College. But in his first year at JC, his mother fell seriously ill and went into a coma. ""We thought we lost her."" Luckily, she recovered.
 But it led to his decision to switch from the humanities programme, which might have meant his going abroad to university, to science so he could enter medical school here and be by her side.
 He did private tutoring to fund his medical studies at the National University of Singapore. When he graduated, he worked at the emergency department of the old Toa Payoh Hospital.
 In 1990, he borrowed $90,000 to pay off the remaining two years of his bond, and started a chain of clinics with two other doctors, one of whom was his girlfriend, who later became his wife.
 Each put $5,000 capital into the venture. Two other doctors joined them and the Healthway Medical Group grew to about 40 clinics.
 At the time, there were GP chains like Raffles and Shenton operating mostly in the business district. Knowing it would be hard to compete against them in the city area, Healthway focused on the HDB heartland and industrial areas.
 The venture exposed him to the business side of healthcare. He learnt lessons like the importance of a good location and how doctors could build enduring rapport with patients.
 In 2001, he and his partners sold Healthway to the British United Provident Association, a health insurance group trying to expand to Asia. The group later divested the clinic business. The Healthway chain today is owned by the Lippo group.
 Just 36, Dr Tan became a millionaire.
 How much did you get from the deal, I ask.
 ""Enough, lah,"" he says.
 Enough for life, I press.
 ""Where I came from, I think it was enough for us,"" he says. ""I'm very happy with eating bak chor mee, although I can't have it every day or I'll balloon, right? But whether it's fish head curry or chicken rice, in that sense we are very low maintenance.""
 His wife went on to found another smaller GP chain. The couple have three children, aged 29, 28 and 22. The two eldest, a daughter and a son, are doctors at the Changi General and National University hospitals, and the youngest, a son, is studying dentistry in Glasgow.
 Thirty-six was too young to retire, so Dr Tan decided to learn more about hospital management, completing a Master of Business Administration at the Singapore campus of the University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business. His research thesis was on running retirement centres in the region.
 He got his master's in 2004, when he was 40, and joined Parkway Holdings. He worked his way up the healthcare group, which has seen ownership changes over the years. He went from assistant vice-president to CEO and managing director of Parkway Pantai, then IHH Healthcare.
 He is credited for having executed multiple acquisitions that helped IHH become Asia's biggest private healthcare group over the last decade.
 Along the way, he had postings in Malaysia. He also took a year off to look after his father, who had terminal liver cancer and died in 2008. His mother had died in 2003.
 He still describes himself as a doctor when he fills up immigration forms. Although he suspended his GP licence when he became a minister, he stays updated on medical matters.
 Going back to being a GP after he retires from politics is an option, he says.
  CLEAR CONSCIENCE  He had his first taste of political grassroots work in the 1990s when he was helping out in former minister George Yeo's Kembangan ward, as his clinic was then in Lengkong Tiga.
 Was it with the intention of going into politics one day, I ask. ""There are so many capable people,"" he says, shaking his head.
 In 2019, he retired after his contract with IHH ended and he began thinking about the next stage of his life. One option was to develop social enterprises, including retirement homes.
 But politics beckoned when Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong asked him to ""serve the country"".
 ""I thought, okay, if I'm not too old and if I'm not holding somebody back or truncating somebody's runway,"" says Dr Tan.
  SELF-DEPRECATING You need to be able to laugh at yourself. People say I'm an 'uncle'. So what if I've got a few more wrinkles? That's what makes us human and defines us, right'
 MANPOWER MINISTER TAN SEE LENG  There was no talk of him taking on a front bench role if the Marine Parade GRC team won. ""I had no expectations. I thought I'd be quite happy as an MP.""
 A key challenge of being a minister has been the debates in Parliament. He has had to answer questions on the spot while juggling his notes, processing new information sent to his phone by his staff, and even handling fiddly microphones.
 While he and his colleagues run through scenarios and potential questions before a sitting, ""you can never adequately prepare for every single question that may be put to you"".
 Referring to a recent debate - on whether foreigners were taking away jobs from Singaporeans - that ended past midnight, he says: ""This rite of passage has been good. I've learnt a lot, and each time I go through this, I feel that I actually get 10 steps closer to my colleagues. It builds that camaraderie.""
 On the issue of jobs, he says he fully understands why some Singaporeans, especially those who are older, are worried.
 A person can work hard and work smart, but an illness, lack of opportunities or some other unfortunate event can put his livelihood in jeopardy, he says.
 ""Look at my mum. She worked very, very hard but we were poor, and I don't think she bargained for her illness.""
 He believes the solution is to have targeted help for groups that need it. The answer isn't to abolish policies that benefit the bulk of the population.
 Of the Government's policies, he declares: ""I'm not someone who came from the system. My career has been on the outside, and I genuinely believe that the system has been fantastic.""
 Getting people to understand policies requires a lot of listening, talking and reassuring. ""I think, sooner or later, sincerity and earnestness will win people over.
 And if all that fails, then the policies will come in and carry them.""
 It has helped that he enjoys engaging with residents at Meet-the-People Sessions (MPS). ""A lot of the grassroots work takes me back to the time when I was a family physician,"" he says.
 ""Visiting their house, listening and so on. Of course last time it was about medical problems, but running the MPS is almost like running a clinic.""
 Getting brickbats is part of a politician's life, too, and I wonder if he has rued not opting for an easier path in this late phase of his career. With his corporate success behind him, he could be spending his days playing golf.
 But Dr Tan says: ""Once I set my mind to do something, I don't look back, so in that sense I'm a perpetual optimist. I think as long as you give your best and your conscience is clear, that is the most important. What I want is a good night's sleep. Clear conscience."" And how has he been sleeping since entering politics'
 ""I sleep very well,"" he laughs as we wrap up the lunch. ""The only problem is I don't have enough sleep. The number of hours keeps shrinking because there is quite a lot of work.""

55,"Tapping AI to boost health science innovations in S'pore; SingHealth and SGInnovate in tie-up aimed at improving diagnostics and treatment via tech
The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 10, 2021 Wednesday","A three-year partnership between SingHealth and SGInnovate to build and scale up health science innovations with artificial intelligence (AI) was announced yesterday.
 The partnership seeks to advance the development and adoption of AI as well as other emerging technologies to improve diagnostics and treatment, and enhance healthcare delivery and clinical outcomes in Singapore.
 Health Minister Ong Ye Kung witnessed the virtual inking of a memorandum of understanding by both parties yesterday.
 SGInnovate - a private organisation owned by the Government - translates scientific research into technology-intensive applications, while SingHealth has under its wing Singapore's oldest healthcare institution, Singapore General Hospital, said Mr Ong.
 One local example of AI in healthcare is the chatbot Doctor Covid.
 It can speak to migrant workers infected with Covid-19 in their languages and enable healthcare teams to better monitor the workers' clinical and mental wellness at community care facilities, Mr Ong said.
 SingHealth's extensive clinical and research capabilities and pool of clinicians and healthcare innovators, together with SGInnovate's deep tech expertise and diverse community of corporations, start-ups and innovators, will maximise the potential of health science innovation.
 Professor Ivy Ng, group chief executive of SingHealth, said: ""We look forward to more AI projects in areas involving big data machine learning, analytics and risk prediction models that can improve diagnostic accuracy, speed up personalised treatment protocols and optimise manpower resources.""
 For a patient, an AI solution when compared with the current standard model of care should produce comparable or superior results in terms of performance, and be of comparable or lower cost, said Dr Lim Jui, chief executive of SGInnovate.
 Calling this tie-up a ""big step forward"", Dr Lim said: ""Previously, things were very informal.
 ""When a start-up company needed an opinion, it would go and get one from a doctor in a public hospital, and it was very hard to get a paid pilot because medicine is inherently and almost necessarily conservative, as there are some risks involved to patients' lives.""
 He added: ""But, of course, it is not opening the gates for everyone. If an idea is not well worked out, it should be rejected. Only the best proposals must go through.""
 The partnership will focus on three main areas.
 First, it will advance AI thought leadership in healthcare and innovation communities.
 The two partners will regularly bring together SingHealth's clinicians and innovators, as well as SGInnovate's public and private sector partners in the health science and innovation communities.
 These efforts include quarterly AI and digital innovation journal clubs to generate awareness in AI and digital innovation, as well as an annual AI In Health workshop to educate industry partners, healthcare professionals and the public on regulations, research findings and the adoption of various AI systems in healthcare.
 Second, the partnership will provide start-ups with the resources they need to develop and grow.
 Mr Ong said that SingHealth and SGInnovate will connect innovators with potential investors, and support start-ups in developing business plans, go-to-market strategies and commercial networking.
 Start-ups with capabilities in big data analytics and AI model development could collaborate with SingHealth to co-develop an AI-based solution that provides personalised medication recommendations and subsequently test it in a clinical setting.
 The third area is developing talent through real-world training opportunities and exchanges.
 The tie-up will tap venture capitalists and multinational companies for on-the-job training opportunities to help local talent develop innovation and enterprise capabilities, Mr Ong said.
 Above all, despite the numerous ways that technology can mimic intelligence, it can never replicate the love, care and empathy of a good doctor, the minister added.
 ""Healthcare is an industry with high compassion and empathy,"" said Mr Ong.
 ""In our quest to raise capability and deliver better care, let's make sure AI works alongside us, not as artificial intelligence, but as augmented intelligence that empowers our healthcare workers to have a greater capacity to bring more love, care and compassion to our patients.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),9-011-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999967027426386}",en,0.9999967027426386
56,"Bone up in pandemic; Inactivity, delayed doctor visits, less sun exposure make matters worse for those with osteoporosis
The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 10, 2021 Wednesday","People with osteoporosis are finding it harder to maintain bone health or are seeing their condition decline as the pandemic puts restrictions on movement and activity.
 Until last year, Mrs Lohambal Rajakrishnan used to exercise outdoors twice a day.
 The 82-year-old retired teacher has been careful to take long walks and do weight-bearing exercises since 2008, when she was diagnosed with osteoporosis. The condition puts her at risk of developing a fracture even after a minor fall, and weight-bearing exercises help maintain her bone health.
 She used to go for a one-hour walk in the mornings and evenings and use the outdoor fitness equipment at her neighbourhood park in Ang Mo Kio.
 However, the Covid-19 pandemic has made her limit her outdoor activity and start doing exercises at home. She does not like wearing a mask while walking. ""With a mask, when you're exercising, breathing becomes very stressful and uncomfortable,"" she says.
 Instead of walking around her estate or in the park, she walks at a nearby carpark at around 4pm, when few people are around.
 While her osteoporosis remains under control, she is finding it harder to maintain her exercise regimen. ""It has not been easy,"" says Mrs Rajakrishnan, who lives with her domestic helper. ""I used to be very stressed out because I couldn't do my walks around my estate. Being outside in a park, in the fresh air, how is that comparable to exercising in your bedroom'""
 The pandemic poses an increased risk to people with osteoporosis, who have low bone mass and may suffer fractures more easily. Those at risk include postmenopausal women, older people, those with a thin build and people with a family history of osteoporosis. An inactive lifestyle, excessive dieting and a diet low in calcium and vitamin D may also increase the risk of developing osteoporosis.
 Doing regular weight-bearing exercise such as walking, running and weight-training can help maintain bone mass.
 Taking calcium supplements and vitamin D can also help. Some patients take oral or injectable medications to treat osteoporosis.
 Anecdotes from patients and doctors reveal that many find it challenging during the pandemic to stay active and get enough sun for their daily dose of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium for strengthening bones.
 A study led by a specialist from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and published this August in peer-reviewed medical journal Osteoporosis International found that the circuit breaker last year in Singapore disrupted patients' medication regimen.
 According to the paper, 74 per cent of patients taking injectable osteoporosis medication administered by health professionals were receiving such injections regularly before the pandemic.
 The circuit breaker caused this figure to drop to 63 per cent.
 Healthcare groups are responding by reaching out to patients on the importance of adhering to their exercise and treatment regimen.
 SGH also has instructions on its website for exercises that older people can do at home to maintain bone health.
 From Nov 19 to 21, charitable healthcare organisation Sata CommHealth is hosting online seminars on osteoporosis and fall prevention during its Osteoporosis & Fall Prevention Festival.
 The SGH paper's lead author, Dr Manju Chandran, director, osteoporosis and bone metabolism unit, and senior consultant at SGH's department of endocrinology, says pandemic-related lifestyle changes have affected patients with osteoporosis.
 ""Being cooped up indoors with lack of exposure to sunlight is a big risk factor for poor bone health,"" she says. ""In addition, people living in smaller apartments may not have any room for exercising.""
 She adds that while no formal studies have been carried out to prove this, ""depression induced by the pandemic and its stresses may also be a contributing factor to people remaining indoors"".
 Another risk factor is that people are deferring hospital visits for fear of contracting Covid-19. This affects the management of chronic diseases such as osteoporosis.
 Dr Aravind Kumar, orthopaedic and spine surgeon, Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, says a large number of people with ""significant orthopaedic issues"" are delaying consultations, and he sees two or three cancellations every week.
 ""Some specifically mention Covid-19 as the reason for deferral. For others, the restrictions on companions in hospitals leads to postponing surgery for elderly relatives,"" he adds.
 ""Thankfully, most orthopaedic conditions can be safely deferred without affecting life and limb. But you can never be sure and it is advisable to seek the advice of a medical practitioner rather than rely on online information, which can be dangerously misleading,"" he says.
 Ms Siti Zubaidah Yusoff, assistant director for community programmes at Sata CommHealth, says people have been delaying in-person physiotherapy sessions because of restrictions on movement and fear of rising Covid-19 case numbers.
 Clients who paused therapy during the circuit breaker ""experience deterioration in their function"", she says. ""Their endurance, balance and speed are not as great as before.""
 Sata CommHealth has responded with tele-rehabilitation services, where a physiotherapist provides video consultations so patients can continue their therapy at home.
 However, specialists like SGH's Dr Chandran note that this may not be suitable for all patients with osteoporosis as they may need a caregiver on hand to monitor and assist them.
  Stay active and get enough sun  People with osteoporosis often do not take the condition seriously until they suffer a fracture and find it difficult to heal, say specialists.
 That is why osteoporosis is known as a silent condition or epidemic in countries with ageing populations, such as Singapore.
 Tour guide Charlotte Chu, 60, was surprised when she was diagnosed with osteoporosis eight years ago because she thought she had an active lifestyle.
 ""It was very scary because I had no symptoms. I had no pain, no aches, so it's easy to not think about it. That's very dangerous because if I have a fracture, there will be so many complications.""
 She used to visit the gym three to four times a week, but now works out at home using exercise videos.
 ""I try to do something every day, but the gym was better because I used to work out for an hour there each time,"" she says.
 She adds that it takes discipline to work out at home. ""You have to put your mind to it. You don't want to sit on the condition because it's not going to get any better.""
 Dr Ang Seng Bin, president of Osteoporosis Society (Singapore) and president of Asian Federation of Osteoporosis Societies, says osteoporosis can be managed even amid the current challenges.
 Among his patients, those who became active or maintained their activity levels during the pandemic managed to maintain their bone mass.
 He gives the example of a 68-year-old woman who started jogging three months ago. Not only has she maintained bone density, but she also has less joint pain and feels better overall.
 However, Dr Ang cautions people to take it slow and exercise safely and with proper form. Many have become deconditioned over the past year and must get back into condition sensibly, he says.
 He finds that many people wrongly assume that taking calcium supplements alone can maintain bone health.
 Weight-bearing exercise and sun exposure for vitamin D are also critical, especially for older people - notably post-menopausal women, who see drastic drops in bone mass after age 50.
 He adds that the best time to accumulate bone density is from age 11 to 13, and that is where Singaporeans are disadvantaged, because children of that age are often made to reduce outdoor activity to study for the Primary School Leaving Examination.
 Dr Ang encourages children and adults to maintain active lifestyles, eat healthily and get enough sun.
 ""It's good to spend more time exercising outdoors. It's not just important for your bones and vitamin D needs, but it's also good for your mental health,"" he says.
    Tips for healthy bones    Healthcare professionals call osteoporosis a silent disease as people with the condition may not be aware of it until they fracture a bone. Osteoporosis refers to the weakening of skeletal bones due to a reduction in bone density, which leads to an increased risk of fractures from even minor trauma, says Dr Jonathan Ti, chief medical officer at DTAP Clinic. People's bone density and bone health have been affected during the pandemic as they exercise less and stay home. First, people are getting less sunlight, which ""is essential for the formation of vitamin D in the skin cells, which plays a vital role in calcium absorption and healthy bone formation"", says Dr Ti. A low level of activity is another problem. ""Weight-bearing exercises and other forms of resistance training have been shown to improve bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis and fracture,"" he adds. Dr Ti suggests getting outside in the sun for at least 20 minutes a day; doing weight-bearing or resistance exercises for at least 30 minutes three times a week; and eating a variety of foods high in calcium and vitamin D, including green leafy vegetables, beans, soya milk and fish like salmon and sardines. Dr Ang Seng Bin, president of Osteoporosis Society (Singapore) and president of Asian Federation of Osteoporosis Societies, suggests following the Shape Up formula for bone health. Stop smoking. Healthy eating. Alcohol in moderation. If one does not drink, do not start. Peaceful mind, improving one's situational awareness to reduce the risk of accidents and falls. Exercise regularly, targeting not just the bones, but also muscle mass and balance. Walking and running are good for strengthening bones. Planking, taiji and yoga are good exercises for developing core muscles and balance. Understand the risk. A family history of osteoporosis, prior fractures, irregular periods or early menopause can increase one's risk of developing osteoporosis. Preventative health through bone mineral density scans to check whether one has osteoporosis. Dr Ang suggests doing these scans at age 65 (for women) and age 70 (for men), or earlier if one is in a higher-risk group. Akshita Nanda

57,"Covid-19 restrictions may have left S'poreans with lower immunity to seasonal flu, common colds: Study
Today (Singapore) - Online
November 11, 2021 Thursday","SINGAPORE - A study has found that the Singapore population might be susceptible to getting the seasonal influenza and common colds when Covid-19 restrictions further relax. This is after a year of mask-wearing, physical distancing and travel restrictions, which may have lowered both the incidence of these illnesses and the population's immunity against them.
Researchers said, though, thatÂ it is uncertain if the lifting of these restrictions may ignite an outbreak of the flu when these viruses return to the community.
Experts are recommending people get the flu vaccination in addition to the Covid-19 vaccines.
Dr Matthias GÂ Maiwald, head consultant of microbiology service at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and one of the study's authors, said that common cold infections, while unpleasant, are important to retain immunity levels.
""They are not all that bad because common cold infections help keep our immunity trained, so to speak,"" he said at a media briefing on Thursday (Nov 11).
""And if that training of the immunity is absent during 2020 or 2021, there is a chance that our immune system is less prepared for a return infection.""
Dr Maiwald is one of the researchers from Singapore General Hospital (SGH), KKH and Genome Institute of Singapore, who examined data of more than 42,000 polymerase chain reaction tests for respiratory viruses performed across three public hospitals in 2019 and 2020.
They collated weekly numbers of tests and positive results for the various viruses to assess trends in respiratory virus infections during the Covid-19 pandemic in Singapore.
The study found that flu activity was at its peak in December 2019 and January 2020, with nearly 30 cases for every 100 samples.
They saw a decline in flu infections in February and March last year, after the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) alert level here turned orange, with just about two cases for every 100 samples.
In declaring Dorscon orange, the Government introduced various restrictions and recommendations, such as temperature screening, a suspension of external activities by schools and advice to cancel large-scale events.
The most substantial dip in flu infections was during the circuit breaker or semi-lockdownÂ in April and MayÂ last year, so much so that influenza A/B - the cause of seasonal flu - was nearly absent for the remainder of 2020.
The circuit breaker restrictionsÂ largely confinedÂ most people, aside from essential workers, to their homes.
Singapore typically has two flu seasons - from December toÂ February, and May to July - which generally coincide with the school holidays when families travel overseas.
The researchers said that although the seasonal flu has remained low, some flu viruses rebound earlier despite continued mask-wearing.
This is in the case of the enterovirus and rhinovirus - a major cause of the common cold among children - which re-emerged during the second phase of the reopening of the economy after the circuit breaker, in the second half of 2020.
Dr Wan Wei Yee, a senior consultant at SGH's department of microbiology said that this could be attributed to children being less compliant with health regulations and hygine precautions.
""They like to touch everything, every surface, they put things in their mouths, they hug people. This behaviour, as well as the relaxed social measures, probably contributed to (this resurgence),"" she added.
The researchers thus urged the public, even people who have recovered from Covid-19, to get their flu vaccine before the start of the flu season, in addition to the Covid-19 vaccines.
Dr Maiwald said: ""If you had Covid-19, it does not confer a known cross-protection towards common cold viruses. The situation with the common cold viruses is specific because there are plenty of them, so you are protected only against the common cold you already had.""",Today (Singapore) - Online,11-011-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999985662420235}",en,0.9999985662420235
58,"Easing of Covid-19 travel restrictions in S'pore could lead to uptick in flu cases, doctors warn

November 11, 2021 (LOAD-DATE)","SINGAPORE - People should take their flu jabs to protect against concurrent infection of both Covid-19 and the flu, which can lead to severe disease, doctors have advised.
This is especially important as Singapore continues to ease its travel restrictions and opens up its borders, they said, adding that influenza cases can be expected to rise.
With the new vaccinated travel lanes, more people here will be travelling abroad during the northern winter that typically sees countries there experiencing a spike in flu cases.
In Singapore, Covid-19 safe management measures such as social distancing and mask wearing have been known to keep in check other unrelated respiratory virus infections, including influenza and the common cold.
This was proven in a research study conducted by doctors from the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and the Genome Institute of Singapore.
The study, published in the scientific journal Jama Network on June 28, combined data from more than 42,000 polymerase chain reaction tests for respiratory viruses across three public hospitals in 2019 and 2020.
Dr Wan Wei Yee, the first author of the study, warned that Singapore travellers will find some countries like the United States and those in Europe having less stringent Covid-19 safe management measures - such as mask wearing and safe distancing not being mandated.
This could mean greater exposure to the flu, and bringing the virus back could put the elderly and more vulnerable people at risk of severe illness or even death, said Dr Wan, a senior consultant at the Department of Microbiology at SGH.
These risks could be mitigated if more people also get vaccinated for flu on top of the Covid-19 vaccines.
Dr Matthias G. Maiwald, a corresponding author of the study, noted a decline in the number of respiratory virus cases from February to March last year and during the circuit breaker period from April to June last year. Singapore raised the Dorscon alert level to orange in February 2020.
This could be attributed to the pandemic response measures - travel restrictions, social distancing, mask wearing and school closures - which likely contributed to bringing down the number of respiratory virus infections, added Dr Maiwald, head and senior consultant in the Microbiology Service of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at KKH.
In comparison, Singapore saw a higher number of flu cases in December 2019 and January 2020, which typically coincides with year-end spikes as people usually travel overseas, said Dr Maiwald.
He noted that Singapore typically has two flu seasons - from December to February and from May to July, which coincide with the winter season in the northern and southern hemispheres respectively.

Dr Esther Tan, a consultant at the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine at SGH, who was not involved in the study, said that based on studies done in the United States and China, about 3 per cent to 10 per cent of Covid-19 patients also developed other viral infections, with the most common being influenza.
She added that getting a co-infection could be worrying for patients who have other long-term illnesses as this would mean increased chances of hospitalisation or death.
Dr Tan recommended getting a flu jab before the incoming flu season at the end of the year. The flu jab should be taken 14 days before or after the Covid-19 vaccine.

60,"Resumption of international travel will likely mark the return of influenza: Experts
Channel NewsAsia
November 12, 2021 Friday 12:10 PM GMT","SINGAPORE: The resumption of international travel and open borders amid loosening COVID-19 restrictions is likely to mark the return of other respiratory infections like influenza, said infectious diseases experts.
Most respiratory viruses started to decline when Singapore moved to DORSCON orange in February 2020, and became nearly absent during the ""circuit breaker"" from Apr 7 to Jun 1 last year, with the strictest pandemic measures in effect, said Dr Matthias Maiwald, a microbiologist with KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH).
The Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level guides Singapore's approach to outbreaks like COVID-19.
The colour-coded system - which has Green, Yellow, Orange and Red categories - shows the current situation. It also indicates what needs to be done to prevent and reduce the impact of infections.
A study conducted by Dr Maiwald and Dr Wan Wei Yee, a microbiologist with the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) showed that in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of Singapore's opening between June and December last year, some viruses ""came back"", but influenza remained almost totally absent throughout this year.
""Our assessment is that the respiratory infections will return sooner or later when the measures are lifted. They will likely return when wider travel resumes, we don't quite know when it will return but we predict it will return,"" said Dr Maiwald.
The National University Hospital (NUH) saw zero cases of influenza this year, said Professor Paul Tambyah, senior consultant with its Division of Infectious Diseases.
Quoting Ministry of Health (MOH) reports on influenza surveillance, Prof Tambyah noted that Singapore had one case of influenza B in July 2021, one in April 2020 and zero cases of influenza A since March 2020.
""As there were zero cases of influenza, there was zero influenza death,"" said Prof Tambyah, who is also a Professor of Medicine at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.
However, the reasons why influenza has disappeared in most of the world while other viruses have reappeared are ""unclear"", he added, noting that this was observed in NUH and across other SingHealth hospitals.
""No one has a good explanation for this. There are various theories including - cross-protection between influenza and coronaviruses, or possibly different modes of transmission between the different respiratory viruses.""
The main reasons for the sharp drop in influenza cases are COVID-19 measures - mask-wearing, increased attention to hand hygiene, social distancing and the shutdown of international travel, said Associate Professor David Lye of Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine.
The return of influenza depends on these measures moving forward, he added.
""It is expected that once most countries open up there will be a resurgence of influenza,"" he added.
""From our study, we did hypothesise that the ... lack of travel was quite strongly associated with the downfall of influenza in the DORSCON orange phase,"" said Dr Maiwald.
""So the reverse conclusion could be true, that when international travel recurs, influenza will come back. That is a reasonable construction.""
A MORE SEVERE FLU SEASON
Safe management measures were ""really effective"" at reducing respiratory infections like influenza, said Professor Teo Yik Ying of the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.
However, it is ""premature"" to discuss deaths from influenza after the COVID-19 pandemic since this depends on whether safe management measures will continue, he added.
It also depends on whether the deaths that would ""normally be attributable"" to influenza would be split between COVID-19 and influenza, said Prof Teo.
In this scenario, Singapore could see slightly lower numbers of deaths from influenza, but a generally higher number of deaths when considering both diseases, he added.
It is also ""possible"" for Singapore to see a more severe influenza season as the COVID-19 pandemic fades, said Dr Maiwald.
""This is possible but strictly speaking, it is not known. We do not have data, but there is such a possibility,"" he added.
One ""nightmare scenario"" after the pandemic is over could be the emergence of a new strain of influenza in early-2023, since the world has not seen influenza for ""such a long time"", said Prof Tambyah.
For example, this may be a new subtype of influenza A, like H2N1, or a re-emergence of H2N2, which disappeared in 1968, he noted.
""And we will be back to square one with the next pandemic. We will have to go through the whole process we went through with each pandemic from 1918, 1957, 1968, H1N1 2009 and now the COVID-19 pandemic all over again from epidemic to pandemic to endemic,"" said Prof Tambyah.
A novel strain or re-emergent strain of influenza will result in more deaths among young people than older folks, like in the 1918 pandemic, he added.
This is also similar to what happened with the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, said Prof Tambyah.
""The older people who had lived through the 1918 influenza A H1N1 pandemic paradoxically did not have as severe disease as some of the younger people, especially pregnant women.
""This applies more to re-emergent strains than a totally new strain, although the experience of countries who have had quite severe disease in children with H5N1 is not reassuring about novel strains of influenza.""
The resulting outbreak could even be worse than the current pandemic, Prof Tambyah warned, noting that influenza has ""some similarities"" with COVID-19.
""It spreads rapidly, can be infectious before the onset of symptoms and vaccines are not that effective in prevention,"" he added.
People are currently protected from severe seasonal influenza ""to a certain extent"" because of previous vaccination or exposure to circulating H1N1 and H3N2 strains, he noted.
""If there is a new strain or a re-emergence of the 1957 H2N2, there is high risk that there will be a rapidly spreading pandemic that could have a much higher mortality rate than the 2 per cent reported globally for COVID-19,"" said Prof Tambyah.
While there are no overseas studies yet that show that a year with fewer influenza infections would then cause a ""rebound"", the concern still remains that the risk is higher if individuals are exposed to the influenza virus and spreads it in the community, said Dr Esther Tan, a respiratory physician with SGH.
The experts who conducted the study urged individuals to not only get vaccinated for COVID-19, but also influenza.
""For individuals 65 years and older we definitely recommend that you do get vaccinated. However, for the individuals that are younger than 65 years old, it is recommended for those that have specific medical conditions or indications,"" Dr Tan noted.
This could include those with chronic disorders of the lung or heart, or recurrent hospitalisations due to chronic diseases like diabetes and kidney or kidney problems, she added. INITIAL: hw",Channel NewsAsia,14-011-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999969980885588}",en,0.9999969980885588

November 13, 2021 Saturday 2:42 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: An injured man unable to descend from a tower crane he was working on was brought down to safety by firefighters and members of an elite rescue squad on Friday (Nov 12) night.
Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) firefighters and specialists from the Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (DART) were deployed at about 8.45pm to a construction site along Beach Road, said the SCDF in a Facebook post on Saturday, describing the operation.
Initially, two firefighters climbed up a cat ladder to reach the injured man who was lying on a platform. The firefighters, assessing that the man could have broken his leg, bandaged and immobilised the injured limb as part of preparation for a height rescue operation. Two DART specialists then climbed up the crane, which reached a height of 70m, according to the post. The two men set up a height lowering system involving ropes and pulleys while another team of DART specialists prepared the area on the ground to receive the injured worker.
He was then lowered in his stretcher using a Power Ascender, a portable device that allows a rescuer to ascend and descend with a casualty.
Once on the ground, an SCDF ambulance crew assessed him before sending him to Singapore General Hospital. INITIAL: ac",Channel NewsAsia,15-011-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999967549444846}",en,0.9999967549444846

 This was proven in a research study conducted by doctors from Singapore General Hospital (SGH), KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), and the Genome Institute of Singapore.
 The study, published in scientific journal Jama Network on June 28, used data from more than 42,000 polymerase chain reaction tests for respiratory viruses across three public hospitals in 2019 and last year.
 Dr Wan Wei Yee, the first author of the study, warned that Singapore travellers will find countries such as the United States and those in Europe having less stringent Covid-19 safe management measures, such as mask wearing and safe distancing not being mandated.

 Dr Esther Tan, a consultant at the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of SGH, who was not involved in the study, said that based on studies done in the US and China, about 3 per cent to 10 per cent of Covid-19 patients also developed other viral infections, with the most common being influenza.

63,"Patients' verbal abuse makes the job even tougher
The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 14, 2021 Sunday","Mr Neo Zhi Yang, 31, has found it hard getting verbally abused by the people he has been trying to help. But the senior pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) tries to be understanding, knowing that the pandemic has hit everyone hard.
 ""It could be due to the uncertainties of Covid-19. And because of that, some patients get anxious and visibly agitated,"" he said. ""But I am thankful for other patients who spoke up for me when such incidents happen.""
 On top of that and the extra workload since the onset of Covid-19, he had to worry about his pregnant wife. She gave birth to a boy three weeks ago, the couple's first child.
 Mr Neo, who is on paternity leave, told The Sunday Times that Covid-19 last year led to more time spent at work and less time with his family and friends. During the circuit breaker last year, he once worked 12 days straight.
 When one of SGH's five pharmacies closed temporarily for the ramping up of the hospital's medication delivery service in April last year, Mr Neo took on added responsibilities. He estimated that his patient load has increased by around 70 per cent since then.
 ""Last year was pretty overwhelming because Covid-19 was new to everyone. There was an increase in workload, and I think many of us felt burnt out and exhausted. Coupling that with unkind patients really made it stressful at times too.""
 But things improved this year.
 ""We are now better adjusted to the situation and are much more familiar with the workflow. It is still not easy, but we have learnt to work around any problems we may have,"" said Mr Neo.
 He said one challenge was the disruption to medicine supply due to shipment delays. ""When this happens, we will inform patients and reassure them about the efficacy of the alternative brand. We will highlight changes in the medication appearances and ensure they are aware of their dosage regimen.""
 When Covid-19 cases surged in August, his workload remained manageable. But the safety of his family continues to be on his mind.
 ""I definitely worry. But I know that mentally, I have to be strong. There may still be some dark days when work piles up, but I love my job. I want to help people, and that keeps me going every day.""

The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 16, 2021 (LOAD-DATE)","SINGAPORE - When a man injured his leg while working in a tower crane 70m up in the air, a Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (Dart) and a group of firefighters had to figure out the safest way to bring him down.
Their eventual plan required more than two hours to be set in place, but it proved a masterstroke, as they took just five minutes to get the worker safely down to the ground.
Speaking to The Straits Times on Tuesday (Nov 16), Lieutenant Ahmad Faizal Abdul Hanan, 45, the Dart rota commander who oversaw the operation, said: ""The team did well that day because they did the assessment and everyone performed their tasks, which led to good planning and a successful rescue mission.
""The information that each of them provides is very important because without it, we can't plan well,"" he added.
Lt Ahmad Faizal was among the Dart specialists from Kallang Fire Station and SCDF firefighters from Central Fire Station who spoke to ST about the rescue operation at a construction site in Beach Road last Friday.
Sergeant 3 Keith Lye, who is cross-trained as an emergency medical technician, and a fellow firefighter were the first to reach the stricken worker, climbing up a cat ladder with a 5kg medical bag and proceeding to treat him while keeping steady on a metre-wide platform of the crane.
He said: ""The worker was groaning in pain. There was no open wound, so we suspected his right shin was fractured. We needed to bandage and immobilise the injury to prevent further aggravation.""
Two Dart specialists then made their way up with anchoring devices, various height rescue equipment and a 200m-long rope weighing about 15kg as the mission to lower the injured man kicked into motion. They secured the rope to the crane, and Dart specialists on the ground attached a battery-operated power ascender to it - the device helps rescuers ascend and descend, and also moves equipment up and down.
Finding a landing spot for the rescuers and the worker in the construction site was another hurdle to cross.
Said Dart section commander Warrant Officer 2 Azmir Ali Ameer Ali: ""Picking a landing spot was quite tricky, as there was scaffolding around the crane. We decided the top of the multi-storey carpark (alongside) at Shaw Tower was the most viable option, as it was vertically below, even though we had to clear a portion of the 2.5m-tall scaffolding there.
""We requested for the construction workers to dismantle the scaffolding, which took about 35 minutes.""
With the landing area cleared, Dart specialist Warrant Officer 1 Muhammad Umar Al-Siddiq Abdul Rahman rappelled down with the worker, who was secured on a rescue stretcher, negotiating a few steel beams jutting out of the crane structure along the way.
Said WO1 Umar, 34: ""At this point, the injured man is facing out and he is seeing this at a height, so I had to constantly assure him that he was safe, we were there for him and that he would live.""

Safely on the ground, the worker, who has not been identified, was taken to Singapore General Hospital.
The entire rescue operation took 2hr 45min and involved 25 personnel from the SCDF in total, including the ambulance crew.
Lt Ahmad Faizal said: ""We were lucky it was not raining or too windy, as that would make the rescue even more dangerous.
""While different operations have different risks, we focus on training, teamwork and safety to mitigate these risks.""

69,"Hit by stroke in their 30s: More young people in Singapore getting the disease
The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 16, 2021 (LOAD-DATE)","SINGAPORE - Two years ago, financial services consultant Joy Chia suddenly had a bad headache while at the mall with her family. Ms Chia, who was seven months pregnant, fainted before her husband could take her to a clinic.
She was rushed to a hospital and found to be having a haemorrhagic stroke - which happens when a blood vessel bursts and causes bleeding in or around the brain.
Ms Chia, who was 32 then, had to have part of her skull removed to relieve pressure in the area. Eleven days later, she underwent an emergency caesarean operation to deliver her baby.
It is rare to suffer a stroke during a pregnancy, and the impact on the baby depends on the stage of pregnancy and the mother's condition, says Dr Tu Tian Ming, a senior consultant at the department of neurology at the National Neuroscience Institute.
""The baby may be harmed in cases of severe stroke, where the mother may experience high blood pressure. This may affect blood flow to the placenta, which may impair the exchange of oxygen and nutrients to the baby.""
Thankfully, Ms Chia's daughter was not affected by the stroke, although she was delivered prematurely and was in intensive care for a month.
As part of her recovery, Ms Chia went for rehabilitation to help regain mobility on the left side of her body.
""I never thought I would get a stroke, let alone suffer from one at a young age. I thought that stroke is something that happens only to older people, which I learnt was inaccurate,"" says the 34-year-old, who has another daughter aged five.
While stroke is more common in older people, it can occur to anyone at any age. In fact, the incidence of the disease among the young has risen significantly in the past decade.
The latest Singapore Stroke Registry report showed that the incidence rate of stroke among those aged 15 to 29 rose from 3.8 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 5.7 in 2019. The incidence rate for those 40 to 49 years old increased from 71.9 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 84.9 in 2019.
As for those aged 30 to 39, the rate dipped from 20.9 per 100,000 population in 2010 to 20.5 in 2019.
Dr Tu says the general rise in incidence rates could be due partly to the increase in medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol within these age groups.
""Younger people may have these risk factors, which may be undiagnosed or uncontrolled, resulting in them suffering a stroke.""

In Ms Chia's case, the cause of her stroke is a mystery. She had gone for regular check-ups with her gynaecologist and had her blood pressure checked frequently.
""There were no risk factors or underlying medical conditions that the doctors or myself and my family were aware of,"" she says.
Property agent Kelvin Leong, on the other hand, had high blood pressure and was 33 when he suffered a haemorrhagic stroke in 2012.
Now 43, he recalls that during a meeting with a client, the left side of his face started to droop and his speech became slurred before he fainted.
When he regained consciousness in the hospital, the left side of his body was paralysed.

After a stroke, patients may experience muscle weakness, paralysis, stiffness or changes in sensation, usually on one side of the body. These can make it difficult for them to move some parts of their body, and patients may struggle with everyday activities.
Like Ms Chia, Mr Leong thought strokes happen mostly to older people.
""Since suffering from my stroke, I've learnt that stroke can happen to anyone. Whether you're skinny or fat, young or old, stroke doesn't discriminate,"" says Mr Leong, who is single.
While he did not require surgery, he had to relearn how to walk as well as how to enunciate his words when he speaks.
While Mr Leong can now walk, he does so with a limp as his left side is weaker. He is still unable to use his left arm and has had to adapt to living with one arm.
""I had to learn how to wear a shirt with one hand, shower with one hand, and feed myself with one hand. I also had to adjust and find ways to get things done with just one arm, like opening a water bottle,"" he says.
But this has not stopped him from picking up new skills, like baking.

During the circuit breaker last year, Mr Leong even started a home bakery business called OhBaker, which stands for onehanded baker. His parents, who live with him, help out sometimes.
His father assists with juicing lemons, folding boxes and sticking labels on boxes, while his mother helps with washing up.
Dr Wee Chee Keong, a neurologist at private clinic Capernaum Neurology, says a younger stroke patient is expected to generally have a better rehabilitation potential than an older patient, though the effects of stroke affect both similarly.
""However, young people going through life phases such as marriage and raising children in a family could have their lives more severely disrupted compared with older retirees. So while the medical outcomes may be better, the socioeconomic impact is much worse for younger people,"" he adds.
For Ms Chia, coping with being a mother to her newborn baby and recovering from stroke was not easy.
She did not have the strength or energy to breastfeed her daughter as the stroke affected the left side of her body, making her unable to walk, raise her arm and swallow. As a result, her daughter was bottlefed by the nurse or her husband.
Feeling less confident, she started wearing a hat in the months before she had a second operation to patch up the right side of her skull. She is now considered fully recovered, though the fingers of her left hand are still weak.
Both Ms Chia and Mr Leong now maintain a balanced diet and exercise regularly.
Before Mr Leong's stroke, he suffered from mild depression and worked 16 hours a day. After his stroke, he slowed down his pace of work and took a 15-month break. Ms Chia has also changed her mindset towards work.
""I have been conscious in slowing down the pace of working and am not pressured to achieve awards at work,"" she says.
""Life is too unpredictable. I view this as my second lease of life and I am consciously living every moment and living life to the fullest,"" she adds.

Act fast when stroke strikes
With every passing minute that the blood supply to the brain is disrupted during a stroke, more brain cells are damaged. Hence quick treatment is important to reduce the loss of brain cells, say experts.
This is why timing is the focus of this year's annual stroke awareness campaign by the Ministry of Health's Stroke Services Improvement (SSI) team.
Titled Timing Is Everything, it will run till next month, focusing on the importance of acting fast the moment that signs of stroke are spotted.
""The campaign calls into focus the important role time plays. In stroke, time is brain and minutes matter,"" says Associate Professor Deidre Anne De Silva, head and senior consultant at the department of neurology at the National Neuroscience Institute (Singapore General Hospital Campus) and chairman of the SSI team.
To spot a stroke and help the person, experts say think of F.A.S.T:
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Face drooping
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Arm weakness
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Speech difficulty
Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Time to call 995
Dr Wee Chee Keong, a neurologist at private clinic Capernaum Neurology, says ischaemic stroke comprises about 80 per cent of all stroke cases, while haemorrhagic stroke makes up the rest.
Ischaemic stroke occurs when blood flow through an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked, while haemorrhagic stroke happens when an artery in the brain leaks blood or ruptures.
Treatment for ischaemic stroke includes dissolving the blood clot causing the blockage with medication or mechanically removing the clot.
For haemorrhagic stroke, the treatment focuses on controlling the bleeding in the brain and reducing the pressure caused by the bleeding.
Patients may experience muscle weakness, paralysis, stiffness or changes in sensation, usually on one side of the body. These effects can make it difficult to move some parts of the body, and patients may struggle with everyday activities.
A patient will usually have to undergo rehabilitation to improve his or her ability to perform daily activities and reduce complications.
Up to 80 per cent of strokes are preventable by making lifestyle changes, including having a healthy diet and exercising regularly, notes Dr Tu Tian Ming, a senior consultant at the National Neuroscience Institute's department of neurology.
Other lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, limiting alcohol consumption and maintaining a healthy body weight are also proven to reduce the incidence of stroke, say doctors.
Aside from SSI's Timing Is Everything campaign, other stroke advocacy groups are also stepping up to raise awareness of the disease.
Stroke Support Station (S3), a charitable organisation that supports rehabilitation for stroke survivors, is focusing on caregiving and family care to support stroke survivors' recovery.
For instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic, S3 pivoted its wellness programmes to go virtual on Zoom, with the Re-Learn and Enjoy Active Living wellness programme for stroke survivors and caregivers. It encourages fitness training, general strengthening and cognitive stimulation through interactive classes such as fitness and music therapy.
The Singapore National Stroke Association also launched its annual Stepping Out For Stroke campaign last month to advocate for exercise and increased physical activity to reduce the risk of stroke.
It also offers online activities such as educational talks and group exercise classes for stroke survivors and caregivers.

A spokesperson for the Schooling family said that he died at the Singapore General Hospital with his family by his side.
""Colin was a giant among men. He would always tell you what he thought, no holds barred. We will miss him tremendously,""Â the spokesperson said.
""The Schooling family would like to thank everyone for their support and words of comfort during this tough time.
""We respectfully appreciate the privacy given to the family during this period.""
Describing her husbandÂ as a ""tough fighter"" in a Facebook post on Thursday, Colin's wife, May, said that he was a ""loving father, a supportive brother, an outgoing uncle, a loyal friend, my husband"".
The 66-year-old said that heÂ was a ""character on (his) own"".

Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment,Â said in her own Facebook post that she had met Colin several times over the years when she was Minister for Culture, Community and Youth.
""He was always gracious, considerate and well-mannered. And his love for his family was always felt steeply. We will surely miss him. My thoughts go to Joseph, May and their family,"" she said.
Colin's diagnosis with cancer had been made public on the family's Instagram account in June this year, about a month before Joseph was due to compete in the Tokyo Olympics.
Like his son, Colin, a fourth-generation Singaporean, was also a keen sportsman in his youth - a tradition that has run in the family.
Colin's uncleÂ Lloyd ValbergÂ was a high jumper who became Singapore's first representative to the Olympic Games at the 1948 London edition.
Aside from being known as a former businessman and a Raffles Institution alumnus, Colin was a hurdler and water-polo player who also represented Singapore in softball.
In 1983, he married his wife May, and when Joseph was born in 1995, the couple devoted their time to raising their child.
In 2009, the Schoolings decided to allow their only son to relocate to Florida in the United States to train and study at the Bolles School, with both parents taking turns to spend six months at a time in Jacksonville to take care of him.
The couple also had to take out bank loans and sell their property in Australia to fund Joseph's training expenses.
A year after Joseph's 2016 Olympic gold medal win in Rio de Janeiro, Colin and May launched the Schooling Sports Academy, with the aim of raising the level of sports in Singapore.
Offering its condolences in a Facebook post on Thursday, the Singapore Swimming Association said that Colin had been a ""strong supporter"" of the association and the swimming ecosystem in Singapore.

 Nonetheless, a few younger female patients who are sure they would not want children still seek sterilisation, said Dr Lim Whui Whui, associate consultant at Singapore General Hospital's obstetrics and gynaecology department.
 Reasons they cite include the convenience of not having to take pills or attend consultations for repeat prescriptions, as well as the permanence of the procedure.
 Meanwhile, younger childless men seek sterilisation via vasectomies for reasons such as not wanting to risk passing on inheritable genetic diseases.
 ""Contraception used to be the woman's responsibility, but men now are more proactive,"" said urologist Lincoln Tan, who has seen an increase in local men undergoing vasectomies. He declined to provide exact figures due to commercial sensitivities.
 Doctors advise that younger patients, especially women, consider other non-permanent options.
 Long-acting reversible contraceptives such as skin implants and intra-uterine devices are viable alternatives, said the doctors.
 Studies suggest that up to 26 per cent of women regret their decision after a sterilisation procedure, said Dr Seet Meei Jiun at KK Women's and Children's Hospital.
 To reduce the risk of regret, hospitals and clinics also offer counselling and a cooling-off period before sterilisation.
 ""Although permanent, the lifetime risk of procedure failure is estimated to be one in 200,"" she said.
 If pregnancies occur following female sterilisation, the woman has a higher risk of having an ectopic pregnancy, or pregnancy outside the womb, she added.
 In comparison, vasectomy carries a one in 2,000 risk of failure leading to pregnancies and is associated with less surgical risk.
 Dr Chong Weiliang, a urologist at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said the hospital reviews sterilisation on a case-by-case basis for younger patients, especially if childless.
 All the senior doctors in the department must agree that the operation can proceed, failing which a hospital ethics board meeting will be convened to decide on an outcome.
 Nonetheless, informed consent is paramount, said Dr Tan.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 22, 2021 (LOAD-DATE)","SINGAPORE - Several hospitals in Singapore are either discouraging or refusing to allow children below the age of 12 from visiting patients despite the easing of Covid-19 restrictions from Monday (Nov 22).
The Straits Times checked on updated rules at 21 hospitals here and found that 10, including Singapore General Hospital and Sengkang Community Hospital, are not allowing visitation rights for those below the age of 12.
Other hospitals with the rule include KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Outram Community Hospital and Farrer Park Hospital.
This condition for visits is posted on the hospitals' websites.
Meanwhile, Mount Alvernia Hospital has advised that children in this age group are ""strongly discouraged"" from visiting its patients.
While the hospitals have not stated reasons for not granting children visitation rights, under current medical guidelines, those below the age of 12 are not yet eligible for Covid-19 vaccination.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) had announced on Saturday that vaccinated people will be allowed to visit hospitals and residential care homesfrom Monday.
Each hospital patient can receive up to two visits daily, and register up to two visitors each time.
Only one visitor will be allowed at the bedside at any one time. Each visit can only last up to 30 minutes, though this may be extended under exceptional conditions.
Patients who are critically ill can admit up to five registered visitors, with two visitors allowed at the bedside each time.
However, several hospitals have spelt out additional rules.
For example, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital have maintained the prohibition on visitors who had been on a cruise to nowhere or overseas within 14 days before their intended visit.
National University Hospital and Tan Tock Seng Hospital are not allowing visitors who have received a health risk warning in the past seven days.
Under MOH rules, visitors must don face masks at all times, as well as refrain from eating or drinking in hospital wards, using patients' toilets in the wards and sitting on patients' beds.
For residential care homes, up to four visitors are allowed with one designated visitor per visit. Each visit is also capped at 30 minutes.

Visitors to the hospitals or homes must also show a valid negative antigen rapid test (ART) result obtained within the last 24 hours.
Those who have recovered from Covid-19 within the past nine months or so exempted from this requirement.
All the visitors and patients or residents must also be fully vaccinated.
""If the patient/resident and/or visitor are not fully vaccinated, in-person visits will only be allowed under exceptional circumstances on a case-by-case basis, as advised by the hospitals and homes,"" said MOH on Saturday.
These exceptional conditions include patients in critical condition; paediatric patients; birthing or post-partum mothers; and patients requiring additional care support.
In such situations, the visitors must produce a negative ART test result obtained from any MOH-approved test providers within 24 hours prior to each visit.

77,"Many ultraviolet-C sterilisers sold online unsafe for home use, pose risk of radiation exposure: NEA
Today (Singapore) - Online
November 23, 2021 Tuesday","SINGAPORE - Households have been advised not to use ultraviolet-C (UV-C) sterilisers at home as many such devices marketed for home use lack safety features that protect users from unintended or accidental exposure to radiation.
In an advisory on Tuesday (Nov 23), the National Environmental Agency (NEA) said that UV-C-based disinfection is intended only for industrial or commercial settings with appropriate safety features and practices.
Exposure to UV-C radiation can cause eye or skin injuries, although no cases here have been reported so far, NEA said in response to TODAY's queries.
Examples of injuries include damage to the cornea, with burning sensations and sensitivity to light, as well as burns resulting in redness and peeling of the skin.
The warning came after there has been a rise in demand for such devices since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
NEA added that it has been working with major retailers and online sales platforms to actively remove listings of unsafe UV-C sterilisers.
To date, about 8,000 online listings have been removed.
""While NEA has made every effort to work with major online sales platform operators in this regard, given the vast number of retailers that may advertise on online sales platforms from time to time, the public is advised to exercise discretion and vigilance when purchasing UV-C sterilisers,"" the agency said.
Members of the public who intend to buy UV-C sterilisers for home use should choose only those which have ""safety engineering"" features that prevent users from being exposed to the radiation, the agency said.
Examples of such safety engineering features are:
Those who have bought UV-C sterilisers that do not contain any safety features are advised to stop using them immediately, especially if the devices are intended for use on the skin,Â NEA said.
Last year, when TODAY contacted NEA to ask aboutÂ the risk of using such devices, it said that there was a need for careful calibration and monitoring.
When asked how safe they areÂ for consumers, medical professionals told TODAY then that people should leave this method of disinfection to trained professionals and proceed with high caution when using UV-C light sterilisers at home.
Professor Christian Kurtsiefer, from the National University of Singapore's department of physics in the Faculty of Science, cautioned then:Â ""If a UV light source kills germs, it is also harmful to the human skin and may cause anything from a sunburn to more serious damage to the skin cells.""Â 
Dr Ling Moi Lin, director of the Singapore General Hospital'sÂ department of infection prevention and epidemiology, said:Â ""One should not be able to look at the UV-C light when it is being shone. When it is turned on, nobody should be in the room.""Â 
She added: ""Maybe it is a nice-to-have item but it's not a must-have. Just use the usual disinfectants to clean whatever you need to clean. You could easily wipe down your phone if you want to disinfect it.""",Today (Singapore) - Online,23-011-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999967194040862}",en,0.9999967194040862
78,"Jail for couple who lied to Covid-19 contact tracers about their whereabouts, activities
The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 24, 2021 (LOAD-DATE)","SINGAPORE - A woman who repeatedly hindered a health officer from carrying out her duties amid the Covid-19 outbreak by withholding information and giving false information was sentenced to six months' jail on Wednesday (Nov 24).
Shi Sha, 38, had earlier been convicted of four charges under the Infectious Diseases Act.
On Wednesday, her husband, Hu Jun, 40, was sentenced to five months' jail after being convicted of a charge under the Act. He had deliberately withheld information from another health officer.
Following a joint trial, District Judge Ng Peng Hong convicted the Chinese nationals on Oct 26.
They were the first two people to be charged under the Act in relation to the current pandemic.
Shi was living in Singapore when her husband flew here from Wuhan, which was the epicentre of Covid-19 at the time.
In an earlier statement, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said Hu arrived in Singapore on Jan 22 last year, and was confirmed to be infected with Covid-19 nine days later. He recovered and was discharged from hospital on Feb 19.
Shi was identified as his close contact and issued a quarantine order on Feb 1 after MOH initiated contact tracing to identify those who may have been exposed to him.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh said in his submissions the couple had lied to contact tracers about their whereabouts and activities in Singapore between Jan 22 and 29 last year to protect their privacy.
He added: ""It was imperative that the MOH obtain accurate information about their movements in Singapore to identify and isolate the persons who had come into close contact with them to stem the spread of Covid-19 here.
""By lying about their movements in Singapore, the accused persons hindered this critical exercise by MOH.""
Between Jan 22 and 28, Hu had travelled to Long Beach @ Stevens restaurant in Stevens Road and Ngee Ann City shopping centre in Orchard Road, among other places.
Senior public health officer Georgina Lim testified in court Shi had told her she was in isolation at home with her husband.
But Land Transport Authority records showed Shi had booked rides from private-hire car service Grab to several locations - including Ngee Ann City - in late January, said Ms Lim.
The records also showed she had booked a Grab ride from Studio M Hotel in Robertson Quay to go to the Singapore General Hospital on Jan 29.

Ms Lim testified this was contrary to what Shi told her - that she had flagged down a blue taxi outside their home to take her husband to the hospital that day.
In his submissions, DPP Koh said the couple had claimed they did not lie to the contact tracers.
""According to them, they knew that they had to cooperate with MOH's contact tracing efforts and, indeed, were doing their level best to provide complete and accurate information to MOH,"" he added.
They had also claimed the charges against them arose from misunderstandings due to a language barrier and the contact tracers rushing through the process or asking questions that were too specific or not open-ended.
The couple were represented by lawyers Steven John Lam and Fiona Oon.
Taking the stand in July this year, Shi told the court she had difficulty communicating with the contact tracer, and that their conversation in Mandarin was like a chicken talking to a duck.
On Wednesday, DPP Koh urged the court to sentence Shi to eight months' jail and her husband to a shorter term of five months.
He told Judge Ng this was a ""high culpability, high severity"" case and the couple were willing to ""place their personal interests at the forefront"".
Noting that at no point was the word ""remorse"" mentioned in their mitigation pleas, DPP Koh added: ""They were determined to be dishonest.""
The defence team asked for Shi to be fined $20,000 and Hu's fine to be set at $10,000.
 Mr Lam said his clients ""generally had good character"" and that Hu had got himself isolated after displaying symptoms of Covid-19. He added that Shi had done likewise as she had been her spouse's close contact.
The couple were offered bail of $15,000 each as they intend to appeal against their convictions and sentences.
For each charge under the Act, a first-time offender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000.
A repeat offender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.

79,"Couple appeal against conviction, jail sentence for obstructing Covid-19 contact tracing efforts
Today (Singapore) - Online
November 24, 2021 Wednesday","SINGAPORE - A couple visiting from Wuhan, China were sentenced to jail on Wednesday (Nov 24) for withholding information from Covid-19 contact tracers.
China national Hu Jun, 40, tested positive for Covid-19 in January last year, nine days after arriving in Singapore from Wuhan to spend Chinese New Year with his family. The Chinese city was then the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.
He did not tell a health officer that he had travelled to various places while infectious, including hotels, a restaurant and the Chinese embassy here.
On Wednesday, he was jailed for five monthsÂ onÂ one charge under the Infectious Diseases Act, forÂ deliberately withholding information from contact tracers about his whereabouts and activities. He was found guilty of the charge on Oct 26 this year following a trial.Â 
His wife, 36-year-old Shi Sha, who was convicted of four charges in October for withholding information, giving false information and failing to respond fully and truthfully to a health officer, was jailed for six monthsÂ on Wednesday.
The couple's lawyer, Mr Steven Lam from law firm Templars Law LLC, said that his clients intend to appeal both the conviction and sentence.
He had initially sought a maximum fine for the couple, in place of a custodial sentence.
NOT ACCEPTINGÂ RESPONSIBILITY
Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Timotheus Koh, who sought theÂ jail term given to Hu, and eight months' jail term for Shi, told the court that the couple have ""clearly not accepted responsibility for their actions"".
The prosecutor said that the couple's mitigation submission showed that they continued to blame their circumstances on the authorities.
The couple also claimed that they should be ""given credit"" for acting responsibly by seeking treatment at a hospital and self-isolating, he added.
On Jan 29 last year, Hu went to the Singapore General Hospital with his wife, when he started coughing and feeling dizzy and warm.
DPP Koh said that this cannot be taken seriously as a mitigating factor.
HuÂ suspected that he had contracted a highly contagious disease, soÂ ""the natural response would be to treat it... out of self-preservation"", DPP Koh added. ""Self-isolation can be seen in the same vein.""
He also addressed another mitigation factor raised by the defence, that the couple had been away from their loved ones in China for a long time.
""They want to return to China as soon as possible to see their aged parents and young children...This should not be a sentencing consideration,"" DPP KohÂ said.
""Taken to its logical conclusion, it will mean that offenders who are foreigners with young childrenÂ or aged parents, or both, will receive more favourable treatment.""
DPP Koh said that in contrast to the sacrifices of Singapore's front-line workers and many others who have made personal sacrifices to stem the spread of Covid-19, the couple have demonstrated that they are ""willing to do the complete opposite and place their personal interests over public health and safety"".
""The courts must signal strongly that such dangerous behaviour is completely unacceptable and that those who defy our laws and who endanger public health will be sufficiently punished.""Â 
In response, Mr Lam said that his clients had never tried to deliberately withhold or mislead the authorities.
Moreover, theyÂ did not initially know that Hu had contracted Covid-19 despite displaying some symptoms such as coughing, because he is a smoker.
The lawyer added that when there were clear signs that Hu had contracted the disease, the first thing he did was to get himself admitted to hospital.
""Their position is that they tried their best. They may have had a misguided idea of what they needed to do, but the reality is that when the investigation officers spoke to them, they gave details.""Â 
Mr Lam also arguedÂ that any custodial sentence would ""serve no purpose"".
""At the end of the day, what we want is a deterrent effect. Would it not also be served by way of a high fine?""
He said that the couple's conviction will mean that they will be ""blacklisted"" and no longer able to enter Singapore easily.
In a way, this was a punishment of its own because it meant thatÂ ""their dreams of having their children have a good education in Singapore would have been dashed,"" he added.
This, in turn,Â would serve as an example to deter other foreigners from committing offences here, he argued.
DPP Koh said thatÂ comingÂ from a place where there was an ongoing coronavirus outbreak at the time, HuÂ ""should have known better"".
The couple could have faced penalties of up to six months' jail orÂ up to S$10,000 fine, or both, for each charge under the Infectious Diseases Act.Â",Today (Singapore) - Online,24-011-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999983607239901}",en,0.9999983607239901
80,"Born at 22 weeks: 'Her chance of survival was close to zero'; Chelsea Kiew made history in 2018 when she became the youngest baby to survive birth at KKH. Her parents share her dramatic story
The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 24, 2021 Wednesday","Ms Aura Lin had taken two sips of her husband's homemade soup when the contractions hit hard.
 Then, her water broke.
 She was just 22 weeks and three days into her pregnancy, which had been a rough one. Beset by vaginal bleeding and a lack of appetite, she had spent much of her time on bed rest.
 That Sunday, on May 27, 2018, she had woken up at about 7pm feeling weak. The day before, she had sought help at a hospital for bleeding and contractions and was told the baby was fine. But the contractions continued despite medication.
 ""My hubby called 995 immediately and the paramedic on the line told me to endure and that help was on the way. I screamed as I could feel my baby coming out,"" Ms Lin, a housewife in her early 30s, recounts in an e-mail interview.
 Her husband Raymond Kiew, 33, braced himself to deliver their first child in their three-room Housing Board flat in northern Singapore, guided by paramedics on the phone.
 His heart racing, he wrapped a freshly laundered towel around his newborn, Chelsea.
 ""I vividly remembered that she opened her small eyes and let out a small cry. Her skin was bright red and she already had quite a lot of hair and eyebrows,"" he says.
 Ms Lin, terrified she would lose their baby, started crying, but says her husband ""calmly comforted me"".
 When the paramedics arrived about 10 minutes later, they rushed the family to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) because Chelsea was so premature.
  RACE TO SAVE BABY  ""Chelsea's prognosis was extremely poor and her chance of survival was close to zero at birth,"" says Dr Tan Pih Lin, a consultant from the department of neonatology at KKH, who was part of the team that looked after her.
 The odds were stacked against Chelsea as she was a ""borderline viability"" baby, the phrase doctors use for infants delivered at 22 to 25 weeks. Babies reach full term at 37 weeks.
 She was born at home without the usual standard of care that mothers in premature labour get, her father ""had to do the initial steps of resuscitation without any equipment"", Dr Tan says, and she had a 15-minute ambulance ride where paramedics administered basic resuscitation.
 ""The majority of extreme preterm babies born in her condition usually arrive in a poor state and pass on very fast despite the support given,"" adds Dr Tan.
 Resuscitation is usually offered to preemies who are at least 24 weeks old, but Chelsea was ""actively breathing and had a good heart rate"", says Dr Tan. Mr Kiew and Ms Lin, eager to save their baby, agreed to the procedure.
 Ms Lin, meanwhile, had been whisked away for post-delivery care.
 When her husband sent over photos, she says: ""My heart sank when I saw them. She weighed only 510g and measured 28cm in length"".
 The medical team worked tirelessly to save Chelsea with a slew of life-sustaining treatments, which were complicated by her fragility.
 Dr Tan says that even regular blood sampling to adjust her ventilator settings had to be measured carefully as ""small amounts taken from her would be significant blood loss (for example, 2ml of blood was 5 per cent of her total blood volume). Chelsea therefore required regular replacement of blood"".
 The baby deteriorated at around the two-week mark, which meant she needed 100 per cent oxygen and maximum ventilator support, Dr Tan adds.
 The precious breast milk which Ms Lin tried so hard to express could not be used because of an issue with Chelsea's digestive system.
 ""We were given the option of accompanying her last moments and she would be taken off life support,"" Mr Kiew says.
 His parents asked him to prepare the religious rites, while a friend arranged for a photographer to take photos of the family together.
 ""We did not take up the option and decided to wait for a few days. On some nights, we would receive calls from the doctors about her critical condition.
 ""Miraculously, she soldiered on and prevailed, clearing milestones one by one.""
 Chelsea is KKH's youngest baby to survive birth. In comparison, the youngest surviving babies at Singapore General Hospital and National University Hospital were 23 weeks old.
 According to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in the United States, only 5 per cent of babies born at 22 weeks' gestation survive to be discharged from hospitals worldwide.
  TURNING THE CORNER  Chelsea spent 166 days in hospital and Mr Kiew and Ms Lin visited her daily before taking the last bus home.
 Ms Lin, who expressed milk daily for her baby, eventually pumped so much that she donated some to the KK Human Milk Bank.
   How Chelsea Kiew beat the odds: Premature babies  Photos of their baby girl provide a peek into their world then, where milestones were counted in days and achievements unlocked in grams.
 One picture dated June 8 is captioned: ""We could finally touch her.""
 It shows a tiny Chelsea hooked up to multiple machines as an adult hand, giant in comparison, gently touches her beanie.
 A pair of photos taken on Aug 2 are titled ""first-time kangaroo care"", referring to the skin-on-skin contact between parent and child that helps premature babies progress faster.
 Even though they are masked, the joy in her parents' eyes is hard to miss.
 Things looked up after about a month, when Chelsea grew strong enough that doctors could reduce her ventilator and oxygen support.
 ""The joyous moment for her parents and the KKH team was when her breathing tube could be removed at 60 days old and she was put on nasal high-pressure support,"" says Dr Tan.
 Mr Kiew and Ms Lin finally took Chelsea home on Nov 9, 2018, although she still needed nasal pressure support for her lungs, Dr Tan adds. The baby was taken off respiratory support some nine months after leaving the hospital.
 Her hospital bill totalled some $330,000, but after subsidies and MediShield, Mr Kiew and Ms Lin paid about $3,000 with MediSave.
  LIFE WITH A PREEMIE  Chelsea arrived home with a phalanx of machines on loan - from an oximeter to portable oxygen support, as well as subsidised medical supplies. Her parents were taught how to operate and replace the parts regularly.
 Caring for her involved a Covid-19-level hygiene regimen of sterile surfaces and hand sanitation.
 ""We turned down visitors, even my parents, as we knew not everyone was aware of hygiene practices because it was not innate (then),"" says Mr Kiew, who works in the banking sector and tutors as a side hustle.
 As his parents were unable to attend the caregiver training sessions before Chelsea's discharge, they could not help the couple, who ended up managing on their own for a few months.
 Beyond their daily routines, they also had monthly hospital follow-ups with various specialists. Each appointment required a London cab booking because Chelsea needed space for her entourage of machines.
 ""For the first year, we constantly felt like we were living on the edge,"" says Ms Lin, who resumed giving home-based tuition lessons a few months after Chelsea came home, albeit with strict hygiene protocols.
 Her husband adds: ""It was a trying period for us. We had to take care of her 24/7 and I had to go to work with insufficient sleep. We got moody easily and got into frequent arguments over trivial matters.""
 The couple were never alone, though. Besides family support, their friends, colleagues and Mr Kiew's former boss reached out to help in big and small ways, including arranging confinement meals and delivering a much-needed breast pump. They also drew hope from other preemie parents in Facebook groups.
 Now that Chelsea is three years old, doctors say that ""her development is on a par with her peers'"", Ms Lin says.
 Their daughter still has a ""small hole in her heart"", which requires annual check-ups, and she wears spectacles for mild astigmatism.
 Chelsea, who will start Nursery 2 next year, is ""learning languages at an alarming rate"", her mother reports. She loves reading and jigsaw puzzles, as well as helping with housework.
 Looking back on their dramatic parenting journey, Ms Lin is grateful ""that my hubby is definitely the most resilient person"", while Mr Kiew credits their daughter's progress to his wife being a ""strong and responsible mother"".
 ""I'm very thankful that Chelsea has very high emotional intelligence. She is able to tell when we are angry and is not afraid to step in to stop us from quarrelling over trivial things,"" Ms Lin says.
 Mr Kiew adds: ""Chelsea continues to amaze me every day. Her grit from the day she was born continues to show, even now.""
 The couple, who shared their story to inspire others during World Prematurity Day, which falls on Nov 17, urge parents of preemies to stay positive.
 ""Believe that your child will get better by the day. He or she will sense the positivity in you,"" Ms Lin says.
 ""Constantly show affection and care, and miracles will happen.""
   What parents need to know about preemies  One in 10 babies in Singapore is born premature or younger than 37 weeks, says Dr Tan Pih Lin, a consultant from the department of neonatology at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), who was part of the team that saved Chelsea Kiew.
 Babies born at 32 weeks or younger account for about 20 per cent of premature births at KKH, which is the largest tertiary perinatal centre in Singapore, with some 11,500 deliveries annually.
 These tiny infants weigh less than 1.5kg and are classified as ""very low birth weight"".
 KKH cares for over two-thirds of such babies in Singapore.
 ""The more premature the baby, the higher the likelihood of complications,"" Dr Tan says.
 Immediate ones include breathing difficulties, abnormal retinal formation and intestinal infections.
 Over the longer term, extreme pre-term babies often have chronic lung disease, which affects their growth, and delayed development, among other conditions.
 Dr Tan offers advice to expectant parents.
  STOP THE GUILT  Premature deliveries are fairly common and over 30 per cent of them do not have a known cause, she says.
 ""Parents should thus not blame themselves.""
  KEEP HEALTHY HABITS  However, mothers should take care of themselves to lessen the risks.
 Make sure underlying chronic illnesses, such as high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease, are controlled before trying for a baby, and especially during pregnancy.
 They should maintain a healthy lifestyle, safeguard their mental wellness and have good prenatal care, Dr Tan says.
  ASK FOR HELP  ""It is normal to feel lost and saddened by premature delivery. Parents can and should reach out to their baby's care team for help during this difficult time,"" Dr Tan says.
 KKH, for instance, has an Early Bird Baby Club, where mums and dads can meet other preemie parents.
 It is also important for parents to keep a positive mindset, she adds.

 ""Getting involved with the care of their baby when possible (doctors and nurses will guide parents on this) has been proven in many studies to improve outcomes for premature babies,"" Dr Tan says.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 25, 2021 (LOAD-DATE)","SINGAPORE - Retired contractor Daniel Raj was at home in his eighth-floor unit in Block 538 Hougang Street 52 on Wednesday (Nov 24) when he heard ""at least two blasts"".
The 69-year-old said ""one was very big - it sounded like a gas drum exploding"", and from his flat, he could see a second-floor unit on fire in the adjacent Block 537.
""The fire was bursting out of the kitchen window, it was worse than the other side. I could hear what sounded like gas blowing out to feed the flames,"" he added.
The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said on Facebook that it was alerted to the fire around 5.45pm. The blaze, which was eventually put out by firefighters, was linked to contents in the kitchen.
Five people - said to be family members from a seventh-floor unit - were taken to Singapore General Hospital and the National University Hospital for smoke inhalation.
No one else was hurt.
Retired technician Johari Sa'at, who lives next to the unit that caught fire, told The Straits Times on Thursday that ""a lot of people live there... I see different young people, (I) don't know if they are renting or what"".
Another second-floor resident, who wanted to be known only as Ms Xie, told Shin Min Daily News on Wednesday that five people were living in the flat and she noticed that they regularly received visitors.
The 45-year-old clerk said: ""I had been worried that with so many people in the unit, clutter would build up - but little did I think something bad would actually happen.""
Mr Johari, 68, who was shopping for groceries on Wednesday when the fire broke out, rushed home after receiving a call from his wife about the incident.
By the time he got back, she had ""run downstairs already... I (went up to) turn off everything inside and I also went down"".
About 20 residents from upper-floor units evacuated their homes before the SCDF arrived. Mr Johari said he saw two women receiving oxygen from paramedics on site.

On Thursday, when ST visited the block around 4.30pm, an acrid smell hung in the air. Soot could be seen on units up to two levels directly above the burnt flat.
The ceiling of a staircase landing outside the unit was also covered in soot.
Beneath that flat is a unit housing the Ang Mo Kio-Hougang Angsana Residents' Network. Maintenance staff could be seen scraping the ceiling and sweeping up debris from the floor.
When approached, an unidentified staff member declined comment, except to say that the work being done was unrelated to the fire.
Mr Darryl David, an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC and chairman of Ang Mo Kio Town Council, told The Straits Times that ""the common area has been cleaned up and we have made arrangements to repaint the affected ceiling"".
He added that the damaged electrical cables and lights in the common area have been replaced.
""We will continue to render necessary assistance to the (people in the) affected unit and coordinate with other agencies where necessary,"" he said, adding that SCDF is investigating the cause of the fire.

November 27, 2021 Saturday","More than $1.37 million has been raised by the SingHealth cluster for President's Challenge 2021 - a record since it started lending a helping hand in 2004 to the annual community outreach and fund-raising campaign.
 Professor Ivy Ng, SingHealth's group chief executive, yesterday presented a cheque for $1,370,888 to President Halimah Yacob at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) museum.
 This year's campaign, themed ""Compassion with #OneKindAct"", was led by SGH, which is celebrating its bicentennial.
 As part of the challenge, the SingHealth cluster adopted five agencies that provide services such as home care and day care for the elderly and the sick, active ageing programmes and special education for children.
 The agencies are Changi General Hospital HomeCare Assist, South Central Community Family Service Centre, Yong-en Care Centre, Metta Welfare Association and Rainbow Centre.
 Because of the coronavirus, fund raising took a digital focus, said Dr Gan Wee Hoe, chairman of the SingHealth President's Challenge 2021 Steering Committee.
 E-donations made up the bulk of money collected through pledge cards, and SingHealth institutions organised virtual bazaars selling items such as bento sets, potted plants and self-care packs.
 The two anchor fund-raising events were a virtual concert-cum-art exhibition on Sept 17, and a digital baton relay two weeks ago that saw more than 450 employees running 230km in 24 hours, going past all SingHealth institutions and polyclinics.
 ""Members of our SingHealth family also managed to interact virtually with clients from the benefiting organisations,"" Dr Gan said.

 Speaking to The Straits Times yesterday, Ms Oh said: ""I still have to go through a few reconstructive surgical operations in the following year. Recovery is slow but I'm getting a lot better.""
 Ms Oh suffered severe burns on about 80 per cent of her body earlier this year while trying to rescue her fiance, Mr Jonathan Long, 29, and four male friends from a burning car after it crashed into a shophouse in Tanjong Pagar.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 28, 2021 Sunday","The Sunday Times looks at what expectant mothers need to know if they test positive for Covid-19.
  Q: I am pregnant and tested positive with an antigen rapid test (ART). But I have no symptoms. What now'  A: Pregnant women should follow a different set of instructions from the default protocol for people to isolate and continue taking ART until they test negative or feel unwell, said Dr Lim Min Yu, president of the Obstetrical & Gynaecological Society of Singapore.
 ""Pregnant women are at higher risk of severe disease. Therefore, if your ART is positive, it is recommended you get a PCR test confirmation,"" he said, referring to the polymerase chain reaction test.
 Patients should not visit their gynaecologist, as such clinics are not equipped to do PCR tests.
  Q: The PCR test confirms I'm positive. What happens to me'  A: Expectant mothers who test PCR-positive should self-isolate in a room with an attached toilet while waiting for instructions, said Dr Lim.
 The Ministry of Health will contact them and take them to KK Women's and Children's Hospital or Singapore General Hospital or National University Hospital for an assessment.
 Those found suitable for home recovery will be sent home, while those who are unsuitable will be sent to a Covid-19 treatment and care facility.
 Those who require hospital care will be admitted.
  Q: What will make me suitable for the home recovery programme'  A: To qualify for home recovery, pregnant women should meet these criteria: Be fully vaccinated, have had less than 26 weeks of gestation, had an uncomplicated pregnancy until the infection, have no co-existing medical conditions, are not living with anyone 80 years and above, and be able to isolate at home.
 As at Nov 12, pregnant women who meet these criteria may be eligible for the programme. Unvaccinated pregnant women who test positive should be admitted to hospital regardless of their gestation period, said Dr Lim. This is because they have higher risks of severe Covid-19. Admitting them will allow them to be closely monitored and to receive stepped-up care if their condition worsens.
  Q: What happens if I test positive during labour'  A: In such a case, the baby's father will not be able to accompany the woman, said Dr Lim. Some hospitals may also not be able to accept Covid-19 patients in labour, so they may be transferred to another hospital. The mother will be cared for in an isolation room by staff wearing full personal protective equipment.
 Most Covid-19 patients are still able to have a natural delivery, said Dr Lim. How long a patient needs to remain in hospital depends on her mode of birth as well as her symptoms.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 28, 2021 Sunday","When a patient's son cursed her parents, Ms Ng, a patient relations officer at the National University Hospital (NUH), was shocked.
 Recounting the incident that happened a few months ago, the front-line worker, who wanted to be known only as Ms Ng, told The Sunday Times that she was in a call with the patient's son and two other colleagues to resolve a compensation issue.
 She did not provide details on the issue to protect the patient's identity.
 Ms Ng said: ""When things did not go the way he wanted them to, he shouted vulgarities at my colleagues and I. Then, he cursed my parents and said he hoped they would die.
 ""He also threatened me, saying, 'You better make sure I don't see you on the street outside'.""
 Ms Ng and her colleagues firmly told him that such comments were unwarranted and explained they could not continue with the conversation. The matter was later reported to their supervisors.
 In another incident last month, a patient told her she was paid to get cursed at, and asked her to just suck it up.
 She said: ""Such incidents sometimes take a toll on me emotionally, and I do get affected.
 ""It can be very draining to experience this especially when we are trying to give our best to patients and their families.""
 An NUH spokesman told ST there have been over 70 physical and 120 verbal abuse cases reported at the hospital in the first 10 months of this year.
 The spokesman added: ""The number of reported cases to date has been fairly consistent over the past few years since a framework to manage staff abuse cases and encourage staff to report such cases was put in place in 2014.""
 Ms Ng left her job as a patient relations officer over five years ago due to a series of verbal abuse incidents.
 The tipping point for her then was when a patient's daughter, whose mother had just died, said: ""You better pray your mother does not die like my mother did.""
 After taking some time off, she returned to NUH in 2018.
 Ms Ng said: ""I am coping well now. Even though some patients and families are difficult, there are also many who are understanding and appreciative.
 ""This is part of where I get my job satisfaction from.""

92,"Borderline abuse can be just as traumatic in the long run
The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 28, 2021 Sunday","""Were you even formally trained? Are you stupid or something'""
 Words like these may not be vulgarities, but are just as hurtful to a healthcare worker when directed at them by a patient, said Ms Tong Yoke Tho, director of quality service management at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).
 Ms Tong was speaking to The Sunday Times about borderline abuse in TTSH and how such incidents can impact healthcare workers in the long run.
 Dr Hoi Shu Yin, TTSH's chief nurse, said: ""Borderline abuse may not be physical abuse or outright verbal abuse that includes racist remarks or expletives, but it tends to be an ongoing abuse that can cause healthcare workers to feel disrespected and distressed.
 ""Staff may not think that the incident warrants escalation, but we encourage staff to report it.""
 Exposure to such prolonged abuse can cause psychological trauma or lead the healthcare workers to feel emotionally drained, added Dr Hoi.
 Ms Geeta Pattath Raghavan, assistant director of nursing at TTSH, noted that a number of foreign nurses make up the nursing workforce at TTSH, and that it is not uncommon for them to be subjected to racist remarks.
 She said: ""There have been occasions where patients tell these nurses, 'You are a foreigner. Go back to your own country.'
 ""Some have even questioned if the nurses were trained locally. Not only does this bring about emotional trauma, but they can sometimes get so demoralised that they cannot think about coming back to work.""
 She added that Covid-19-induced visitation limits at hospitals have also led to a handful of patients' families getting frustrated.
 ""I have had people tell a few of my nurse managers, 'Don't act like a god' when they were unable to get an extension of visitation hours. We try our best to accommodate when we can, but such rules are also for their safety,"" said Ms Geeta.
 Healthcare workers at TTSH are trained to recognise an abusive situation and escalate it to their supervisors so that action is taken to keep patients and staff safe.
 Ms Tong said: ""There is also a staff support staff programme, where our healthcare workers are encouraged to look out for one another. And when an incident occurs, they know to step in and try to mediate the situation.
 ""They will also follow up and check on how their peers are doing, especially if they have been abused.""
 She reiterated that while such incidents do happen, most of the patients and their families have been very understanding.
 Dr Hoi added: ""The incidents we spoke about should not be generalised. Most of the people we care for have shown so much appreciation to us over the years. And we could not be more thankful for that.
 ""Regardless of what happens, our mission remains the same. We will always look after our patients and ensure they receive the best possible care.""

 In 2018, there were 1,080 cases reported and this rose to 1,200 cases in 2019. The number of cases spiked to 1,300 last year.
 MOH did not provide figures for the first 10 months of this year.
 It said it takes all cases of abuse and harassment against healthcare workers seriously and added: ""We adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards abuse and harassment of our healthcare staff and will take action against persons who do so. Our healthcare workers deserve to work in a safe environment while they care for patients.""
 But reported figures may not reflect what is happening on the ground, said Associate Professor Peter George Manning, emeritus consultant at NUH's emergency medicine department.
 Prof Manning, who is also the vice-chairman of NUH's medical board, said: ""There are abuse cases that go unreported. Sometimes when nurses and doctors face an abusive patient, they'd rather brush it off and not make a fuss about it.
 ""But it's a serious issue and it's worrying because they suffer in silence, until they reach a tipping point.""
 He recalled how an elderly male patient had grabbed a nurse's breast on two occasions last year.
 Said Prof Manning: ""He was severely told off and he did not do it again.
 ""But there was another incident that also happened last year where a male patient asked a young nurse if she was interested in providing him with sexual services. She was flabbergasted.""
 The patient was subsequently given a stern talking to by a senior doctor and a senior nurse after the young nurse reported the incident.
 Prof Manning added that verbal abuse cases at NUH has specifically seen an increase this year as compared with the past few years, but noted that there could be more abuse cases the hospital is unaware of.
 He added: ""That is why we have been focusing our efforts to get the message across to staff to defend themselves by reporting the incident. They know not to get into a fight with the patient, and they are aware of what they should not put up with.""
 An NUH spokesman added that patient-facing front-line staff like doctors, nurses, allied health personnel, housekeepers and security officers are more susceptible to physical and verbal abuse due to the greater exposure and interaction with patients and their family members.
 Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases said they have seen an increase in abuse cases.
 A TTSH spokesman said that in 2019, the facilities saw 218 cases and this fell to 158 cases in 2020.
 But cases have spiked to 244 in the first 10 months of 2021.
 Adjunct Associate Professor Habeebul Rahman, chairman of the well-being committee at TTSH, explained there was a dip in last year's figures due to fewer visitors at the hospital.
 He said: ""But the numbers have been increasing not just because people may be facing more stress, but also because more of our healthcare workers are seeing the importance in reporting an abuse case when it happens.""
 At Singapore General Hospital (SGH), the number of abuse cases has been increasing over the years.
 Ms Jennifer Wee, its chief communications officer, said there were close to 180 cases from January to October this year, up from about 70 cases for the whole of 2017. In 2020, the hospital saw about 170 cases.
 At Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, there have been 35 cases recorded in 2021 so far. The hospital saw about 38 of such abuse cases each year from 2017 to 2020.
 Meanwhile, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital said the number of reported healthcare worker abuse cases has almost doubled from 2016 to 2020. It did not provide figures for that period and for this year.
 But things seem to be improving at Changi General Hospital (CGH).
 Its chief operating officer, Ms Sandra Koh, said the hospital has seen nearly 100 cases of abusive behaviour against healthcare workers in the first nine months of 2021. There were 200 cases reported at CGH for the whole of 2020.
 She said more than 80 per cent of the verbal abuse cases were committed by patients, while the rest were committed by the patients' family members.
 One incident it saw this month involved a patient who got angry when he realised he could not go home after being hospitalised for a week.
 He yelled expletives and derogatory racial slurs at the doctor and the nurses trying to help him.
 The doctor tried to calm him down. But the patient took off his shirt and threw things at the healthcare workers around him.
 The patient even threatened to sue the hospital.
 To tackle such incidents, healthcare workers at TTSH have been taught escalation protocols should the need to report an abuse incident arise.
 Ms Geeta Pattath Raghavan, assistant director of nursing at TTSH, said: ""There are also panic buttons placed at each ward which healthcare workers can press should they feel unsafe or threatened.
  NOT SUFFERING IN SILENCE But the numbers have been increasing not just because people may be facing more stress, but also because more of our healthcare workers are seeing the importance in reporting an abuse case when it happens.
 ADJUNCT ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR HABEEBUL RAHMAN,  chairman of the well-being committee at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, on the spike in abuse cases to 244 in the first 10 months of 2021 at the hospital and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. He explains that last year's dip in cases was due to fewer hospital visitors.  ""When it is pressed, staff from adjacent wards and security officers will be alerted and will assist where they can.""
 But this is not a response used to scare the patients, said Prof Habeebul. ""This is really just to protect all parties and perhaps even prevent the patient from doing something that is irreversible,"" he added.
 While such measures are important, Prof Habeebul said he hopes for mutual respect between all parties. ""At the end of it all, we just want our patients to recover and get well,"" he added.",The Straits Times (Singapore),27-011-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999978184222886}",en,0.9999978184222886
94,"Kerry Mok's taking Sats beyond airports; The strategy to grow non-travel related businesses is paying off, with promising quarterly revenue
The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 28, 2021 Sunday","Just when you think you are over the worst of one crisis, fresh challenges jump up to confront you.
 Mr Kerry Mok, the incoming president and chief executive officer of airline ground handler and food service provider Sats, has never been one to allow a sense of victim-hood affect him, through the years he matured from an infantry platoon commander during national service to the start of his corporate life with Accenture, and onward to logistics firms DHL, Goodpack and YCH Group, from where he arrived at his current perch as head of the Sats food business.
 But as newer and possibly more dangerous strains of the Covid-19 virus emerge, damaging travel just as nations are attempting a tentative opening up, even a fit, food-loving 50-year-old like him, schooled in the rigours of the supply chain and with a penchant for Test cricket because of its cerebral nature, must wonder: Is my tenure as the Sats boss slated to be one long night of fire control'
 At last year's peak of the pandemic, Sats went from supplying 100,000 meals a day in Singapore to just 3,000. The company slid into a loss. The recent uptick in performance recorded in the six months to Sept 30 owes a good deal to continued government subsidies.
 ""The South African variant makes us a bit cautious, but overall, with vaccinated travel lanes starting, the mood in Sats has generally lifted,"" says Mr Mok, who held a discussion with key staff on Friday after news of the new strain emerged. ""We will apply the lessons we have learnt from previous outbreaks and do our utmost to tackle this within the airport community.""
 Once a steady dividend play, Sats is unlikely to resume payouts until it can stand profitably on its own feet. Its share price fell below $4 on news of the mutant.
 And yet, it is not that everything is doom and gloom. Sats' strategy to grow non-travel related revenue could be paying off, with revenue from non-travel related businesses in the July-September quarter up 27 per cent over the year-ago period, and representing 47 per cent of the total revenue.
 Cargo handling is seeing a steady boost as well. According to the International Air Transport Association, global cargo tonne kilometres in September were up 9 per cent over pre-Covid-19 levels. That is only expected to continue, with the burst in e-commerce adding more lift to the business.
 ""From a demand and volume perspective, I believe the uptrend will continue, but not without uncertainties,"" says Mr Mok.
 ""The pandemic opened our eyes to new opportunities, such as expanding our non-travel business. And we cross-trained, upskilled and redeployed people across our ground handling and food operations. We even trained our passenger services colleagues to help with dishing meals and in food safety standards.""
 Just before the pandemic, Sats had bought out Brazilian protein company BRF's share in their joint venture, SATS BRF Food Pte Ltd, which became wholly owned subsidiary Country Foods.
    Fast facts     Mr Kerry Mok, 50, will take over as president and chief executive officer of Sats on Dec 15. He is currently CEO of its food solutions division, a position he took on in July 2018. Mr Mok was earlier CEO of logistics company YCH Group and acting CEO and chief operating officer of Goodpack Ltd. Before that, he led the Asean Supply Chain Strategy practice at Accenture. Prior to that, he was senior vice-president of DHL. Mr Mok has a Bachelor of Business (Accounting) from Monash University in Australia. He and his wife are parents of three children, aged between 16 and 21 years. Mr Mok plays golf, and has a handicap of 18. He enjoys watching Test Cricket for its cerebral approach to the sport.    Sats is the leading provider of food solutions and gateway services at Singapore's Changi Airport. It also has a global presence spanning Saudi Arabia to Japan, and operates in more than 55 locations in 14 countries. Established in 1972 as a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines, it was listed on SGX in 2000 and hived off from the parent company in 2009. The company has 11,000 employees. In the 2019/20 fiscal year, its last full year of operations before the Covid-19 pandemic, Sats reported revenue of $1.94 billion and 166 million meals served. It reported a profit of $13.2 million for the six months ended Sept 30, reversing a loss of $76.9 million a year ago. It has a market capitalisation of $4.5 billion.  
 That gave Sats control of a distribution business and it began sending baked goods around to convenience stores at a time when people were buying more products. One poll even suggested that its Farmpride buffalo wings was No. 1 in taste.
 ""The mindset now is: Even after aviation volumes return, are we going to continue with the non-travel business that we have been focusing on? The answer is, absolutely, yes! One thing I learnt at DHL was the value of having a diversified portfolio across different industry sectors.""
 The company began its journey when the first flights departed from Kallang Airport in 1947, eventually arriving in Changi in 1981. Established as a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines in 1972, it was listed on SGX in 2000 before the divestment in 2009. Today, Temasek owns about 40 per cent of its stock, and it operates in 55 locations across 14 countries.
 What are his priorities as he takes charge of Sats? People and the company culture top his list. Getting the staff involved, regardless of seniority, in the larger purpose of the organisation is important, he says. At his first workplace, Andersen Consulting, which subsequently became Accenture, all parts of the firm remarkably used to speak the same language worldwide.
 Being able to visualise the customer as a friend, relative or colleague benefiting from your work is essential to build momentum.
 Another priority is to build strong teams even as many of the senior company figures around him have spent more time at the firm than he has, and are extremely capable executives themselves. He thinks he should be up to the task: As a 19-year-old second lieutenant, his platoon sergeant at the time had been older by more than a decade.
 You can pull it off, he says, if you can be humble enough to acknowledge that you cannot know everything.
 But it is his third priority that I found most interesting: Finding the right customers and partners.
 It is an insight he apparently picked up at DHL, when he worked closely on fashioning logistics solutions with Hewlett Packard, the Silicon Valley icon that had itself bought Compaq in 2001, three years after Compaq and Digital Equipment Corp merged in the biggest such deal of that time in the computer industry.
 ""I know the old adage that the customer is always right. But in this day and age, the right customer and the right partner are (also) critical,"" he says. ""With the right customer, you can do a lot more and when you put global solutions together, it becomes a very powerful thing. It has to be the right kind of growth; growth for growth's sake may not be sustainable.""
 Sats has significant expansion plans, including through acquisitions. It has set itself a $3 billion revenue target by 2025, by which time it projects non-travel revenue to account for 35 percent of the total.
 Cargo terminal operations, in Singapore and elsewhere, will be part of that growth story. Sats' overseas ventures began with a joint venture in Maldives in 1988.
 Today, it has a footprint that stretches from Saudi Arabia to Japan. There might be some catching up to do. Firms such as Dnata of the United Arab Emirates, which learnt so much from Sats in its initial days, have a much bigger global presence.
 Throughout the pandemic, Sats, under the departing Alex Hungate, continued to invest in critical innovations. It established dedicated, digitally connected command centres to enable the company and its customers to optimise real-time decision-making together by extracting and sharing relevant data.
 These digitalisation efforts will create intellectual property Sats can potentially utilise, including as it expands its offerings overseas to drive growth.
 More importantly, Sats intends to bring greater value to its local partners to build more digitally connected hubs that support data exchange and linkages. Mr Mok expects this could pave the way to digitalise future ground handling and cargo operations even more.
 Significant automation also awaits. In Hong Kong, where it has a large presence, Sats has introduced driverless tractors, something that is currently undergoing proof of concept studies in Singapore.
 Mr Mok says he expects staff strength to rise from the current 11,000, albeit in roles that fit the emerging requirements.
 Meanwhile, he has the responsibility to nurture the relationship with his No. 1 client, former parent Singapore Airlines. As fuel prices rise and with airline managements eager to swing back to profit, he can expect pressure on what Sats charges customers for its services.
 The Sats-SIA relationship became even closer during the pandemic, he says. For instance, the two shared data to analyse operational trends, and worked as one team to manage ground handling operations. Likewise, the two are coordinating on improving customer satisfaction with food on South-east Asian routes, including introducing sustainable tableware with improved heat retention so passengers can be served dishes like congee or laksa.
 ""If we want to be in a strategic partnership with our customers, we have to think about the possible solutions out there that can help mitigate these circumstances for them,"" he says. ""We should think on their behalf. You don't want to go in there and just present the bill.""
 In the airline business, there is no getting away from food as a travel essential.
 Indeed, in Sats' mission statement - ""feed and connect communities"" - food gets mentioned ahead of gateway services. This, after all, is a Singaporean company.
 Mr Mok, who grew up eating the hawker food in the Dorset Road area - he still goes there for coffee while his wife does the weekly grocery shopping - is committed to firing up Sats on the food front, and moving ""airline food"" away from being a cliche synonymous with pedestrian fare.
 Sats recently launched the F&B brand accelerator programme FoodFlix and works with famous hawkers to bring them into different channels that it manages, including food catered for NSmen and schools.
 It is a simple enough concept. People enjoy food with their eyes too, and so much is about perception. If you are lining up for, say, chicken rice, your instinct would be to go to Wee Nam Kee, unless the queue before its shop is too long.
 ""Now that travel is more accessible to people, and with the access they have to social media, the demands placed on us are much higher,"" he says.
 ""When you work for the world's best airline and airport, you also must be the best ground handler and in-flight caterer.""
 Mr Mok is also driving Sats into expanding food production and distribution in Singapore and beyond. Large central kitchens are going up in Thailand, China and India. Last month, it opened a huge kitchen outside Bengaluru's airport.
 Among its various overseas joint ventures, Sats works with both Tata Group and Air India, soon to be folded into Tatas. Mr Mok says that the profitable relationship will only strengthen with the merger.
 The company's annual report mentions Sengkang General Hospital as a client, and I ask what he, a nurse's son, intends to do with the obvious opportunity of supplying quality, healthy food to hospitals, which can then focus on patient care.
 Mr Mok says this is a work in progress. Across town at Singapore General Hospital, Sats already offers a contactless dining experience at the Housemen's Canteen, where it took over operations from a traditional coffee shop operator. As for hospital diets, there are more ingredients available today that, for instance, can address issues faced even by diabetics.
 ""At Sengkang General Hospital, we introduced a healthier Hokkien mee with the approval of the dietitian. Prata, as well, after several rounds of discussions and fine-tuning the dish with our customer,"" says Mr Mok.
 Industry veterans I spoke with suggest that although an accountant by training, Mr Mok's deep experience in the supply chain - his previous job was CEO of the Robert Yap-owned YCH - could make him just the right executive for the challenges faced by Sats.
 After all, whether you are providing a service or product, there is always a supply chain element, and so much is process-driven and logical.
 ""When I first came, I looked at things from a supply chain manufacturing and order fulfilment perspective. It was the culinary aspect of the business that was new to me,"" says Mr Mok.
 ""I still remember my first food tasting where I ate everything that was served to me - you can imagine how many dishes there were - but I was brought up not to waste food, so I had to finish it. I learnt from my colleagues to pace myself.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),27-011-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999968745144759}",en,0.9999968745144759
95,"2 kids among 4 taken to hospital after PMD fire; 40 people evacuated by police as precaution following blaze in Sembawang Drive
The Straits Times (Singapore)
November 30, 2021 Tuesday","Two children, believed to be under the age of five, were taken to hospital following a fire that broke out in the wee hours of Sunday morning.
 Early investigations into the cause of the fire indicate that it was of electrical origin from a personal mobility device (PMD) in the living room of a flat, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).
 SCDF was alerted to the fire in Sembawang Drive at 2.10am, and, in all, four people were taken to hospital for burn injuries, or smoke inhalation, or both.
 Six occupants from the affected unit in Block 466C had self-evacuated prior to the SCDF's arrival.
 Two were taken to Singapore General Hospital, while another two were taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital.
 The remaining two occupants were assessed for injuries, and they subsequently declined to be taken to hospital, said SCDF.
 Forty people were evacuated by the police as a precautionary measure, it added.
 When The Straits Times arrived at the unit yesterday afternoon, members of the family were spotted outside the blackened doorway.
 They declined to comment, saying that they were still traumatised by the fire.
 SCDF said the fire involved the contents of a living room in a sixth-floor unit.
 The rest of the unit suffered heat and smoke damage.
 The blaze was extinguished with a compressed air foam backpack and a water jet.
 Residents in the building told ST that they were allowed to return to their homes at about 3.30am.
 Housewife Maimon Mohd Ariff, 57, who lives next door to the affected unit, said she woke up on Sunday morning after she smelled smoke.
 Pointing to the blackened ceiling outside the unit, she said: ""My neighbour pushed open their front door and a lot of black smoke suddenly came out. It was scary, we couldn't see anything.""
 The couple living in the unit above the affected flat said that they were woken up on Sunday at about 2am when their next-door neighbours rang their doorbell and banged on their door.
 ""When we came out of the bedroom, we saw thick, black smoke and the floors felt warmer,"" said Madam Mariahnah Maarof, 50.
 The human resources executive added that the police arrived shortly after and told them to evacuate the building.
 Her husband, Mr Damak Tajudin, 50, a deliveryman, said that he carried his 78-year-old mother, a wheelchair user, out of the flat to the lift lobby with the help of police and SCDF officers. The officers told him the lift was safe to use.
 The couple added that later on Sunday evening, they heard a cracking noise coming from the floor of their living room before the tiles abruptly popped up.
 ""I thought the floor was going to collapse,"" said Madam Mariahnah.
 The SCDF reminded the public of measures to take to prevent PMD fires.
 These include not charging the devices close to combustible materials, not leaving them charging overnight, and ensuring that the PMDs are properly certified.",The Straits Times (Singapore),29-011-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999989742530639}",en,0.9999989742530639
96,"Jewish museum opens in Waterloo Street; It traces the 200-year history of Jews in Singapore
The Straits Times (Singapore)
December 3, 2021 Friday","Few know that the Maghain Aboth Synagogue, meaning ""Shield of Our Fathers"", in Waterloo Street is Asia's second-largest and South-east Asia's oldest synagogue.
 Built in 1878, the initially one-storey building has over the years been made bigger and become the unofficial centre of Jewish activity here.
 Yesterday, it hosted a ceremony that launched the country's first Jewish museum - the Jews of Singapore Museum, which traces the 200-year history of the Jews here.
 Located on the first floor of the synagogue's neighbour, the Jacob Ballas Centre, it covers the community's arrival in Singapore soon after it became a British colony in the early 1800s till March this year, when a 20-year-old man was detained for planning a knife attack at the Maghain Aboth Synagogue.
 The narrative it tells pauses at several key Jewish figures in Singapore's history. A panel is dedicated to Mr David Marshall, who was chief minister of pre-independent Singapore from 1955 to 1956, and a room to Mr Jacob Ballas, benefactor of the Jacob Ballas Centre and chairman of the Malaysia and Singapore Stock Exchange from 1964 to 1967. Other notable names include former Supreme Court judge Joseph Grimberg, pioneering surgeon Yahya Cohen and Sir Manasseh Meyer, a prominent businessman whose name adorns one of the buildings at the National University of Singapore's Bukit Timah campus.
 ""They are a reminder that greatness sometimes comes in small numbers,"" said Mr Nash Benjamin, president of the Jewish Welfare Board, referring to the modest population of Jews here, who number between 2,000 and 3,000 today.
 ""Singapore's Jewish community is the oldest continuing Jewish community in South-east Asia, which has unfortunately witnessed the disappearance of various Jewish communities, leaving behind memories of what was,"" he added.
 ""In all this, Singapore is a singular exception. We can never take this for granted.""
 The museum was conceptualised about three years ago and was planned to have been launched with the Singapore Bicentennial in 2019, but was delayed until now.
 Mr Benjamin said the community had felt that a museum for the community that is open to all Singaporeans has been long overdue.
 There are write-ups about Jewish rites and festivals in the museum so those interested can get a crash course in Jewish culture, which Mr Benjamin said is still little understood by those who are non-Jewish.
  A SINGULAR EXCEPTION Singapore's Jewish community is the oldest continuing Jewish community in South-east Asia, which has unfortunately witnessed the disappearance of various Jewish communities, leaving behind memories of what was. In all this, Singapore is a singular exception. We can never take this for granted.
 MR NASH BENJAMIN, president of the Jewish Welfare Board.     Three Jewish giants of history remembered    FIRST CHIEF MINISTER DAVID MARSHALL Born in 1908, Mr David Saul Marshall was Singapore's first elected chief minister from 1955 to 1956, leading the charge in Singapore's bid for self-government. He led an all-party delegation to London in 1956 to negotiate with the British, but the failure of talks eventually led to his resignation. During his short stint as chief minister, many incidents of civil unrest, including student demonstrations and the Hock Lee bus riots and strikes took place, as people here began to strain against the strictures of the colonial social order. He later founded the Workers' Party in 1957 and served as Singapore's ambassador to France, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland between 1978 and 1993. Mr Marshall had a strict Orthodox Jewish upbringing and was the first elected president of the Jewish Welfare Board, which continues to provide for the Jewish community. STOCKBROKER AND PHILANTHROPIST JACOB BALLAS Mr Jacob Ballas was a pillar of the Jewish community and was the former chairman of the Malaysia and Singapore Stock Exchange from 1964 to 1967. Born in 1921 in Iraq, his family moved to Singapore after the rubber market crash in the late 1920s. He first sold the bread his mother baked around the neighbourhood, before becoming a car salesman and later a stockbroker. As chairman of the stock exchange, he introduced strict listing requirements and new rules to control trading. While he was at the helm, the paid-up capital of listed companies rose from $870 million to almost $2 billion, and the number of companies whose shares were traded on the exchanges doubled. Upon his death in 2000, his estate, which is said to have been worth more than $100 million, was split between charities in Singapore and Israel. PIONEERING SURGEON YAHYA COHEN Dr Yahya Cohen was a giant in the medical profession and was a distinguished surgeon, well known internationally. As the clinical professor of surgery at the then University of Singapore from 1969 to 1977, he was teacher and mentor to hundreds and thousands of medical students in the region. He was a senior surgeon at the Singapore General Hospital from 1960 to 1972, and was the president of the Singapore Medical Association from 1961 to 1962. Dr Cohen, who was born in 1920 here, authored many scientific papers in international journals and was a member of many boards of trustees of Jewish charities. He died in 2003. Clement Yong
 One interesting tradition cited is the pouring of water on the back of a person's car as he departs for the airport for good luck.
 After a boy is circumcised, the mother and child must be on the same floor of the house for 40 days, and the child taken out to cross seven bridges.
 Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who months before had stood in front of the synagogue in solidarity with the Jewish community after a planned attack on those leaving the synagogue was foiled, was guest of honour at the launch.
 ""If you look at the roads - Frankel Estate, Meyer Road... Jews have made a tremendous contribution. They've added to the richness of our history and our society today, and I'm very glad that this museum showcases the history for future generations,"" he told reporters.
 He said in his speech to a congregation gathered for the event: ""As Minister for Home Affairs, I have said more than once to you: The safety and security of all in Singapore, including the Jewish community, is a key priority. The Jewish community is not just a part of Singapore but it also thrives in Singapore.""
 He also paid tribute to the seven Israeli advisers who came to train Singapore's first soldiers, narrating a story in which Mr Lee Kuan Yew, then prime minister of a newly independent Singapore, had to be ushered to his office by a Malaysian soldier because the new nation did not have an army then.
 ""Because of our regional situation, we had to call (the Israeli advisers) Mexicans, we could not call them Israelis. This group was decisive in making contributions, training officers and soldiers, and building up professionalism in our armed forces.""
 Members of the Jewish community said the community is more integrated with Singapore now than ever before. At a lunch it hosted for reporters, mutton briyani and spaghetti mee goreng were served, with ingredients sourced from a kosher supermarket in the Jacob Ballas Centre that is frequented by Singaporeans of other cultures and foreigners, including Koreans.
 Mr Benjamin said: ""We are very grateful that we live in a pluralistic society like Singapore where there is no anti-Semitism. We welcome anyone to come visit.""
 The museum is open free of charge to the public but people must make an appointment to visit. More information can be found at www.singaporejews.com/museum",The Straits Times (Singapore),2-012-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999964500826114}",en,0.9999964500826114
97,"Singapore scientists' 15-min saliva test as good as PCR test; The antigen rapid test can detect Omicron, and can even be done after eating
The Straits Times (Singapore)
December 9, 2021 Thursday","Scientists here have developed a saliva antigen rapid test (ART) which is just as accurate as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, yet takes only around 15 minutes to detect Covid-19.
 The self-administered test has an accuracy rate of 97 per cent and is able to detect different Covid-19 viral variants, including Omicron.
 The test kit may also be able to hit the market in as soon as three months.
 The 15 minutes or so needed to obtain the results of the test, known as the Parallel Amplified Saliva rapid POint-of-caRe Test (Pasport), is similar to the shortest time needed for current ARTs. For PCR tests, it takes between a few hours and three days to get results.
 The test is the result of a research collaboration between Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore General Hospital (SGH), National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) and the National University of Singapore (NUS).
 Dr Danny Tng, a medical officer at the Department of Infectious Diseases in SGH, and the lead inventor behind the test, said that Duke-NUS and SingHealth have also entered into a licensing agreement with medical supply company Digital Life Line for its commercialisation.
 Professor Soo Khee Chee, Benjamin Sheares Professor in Academic Medicine at the SingHealth Duke-NUS Oncology Academic Clinical Programme, said that the test, which requires the approval of the Health Sciences Authority for use here, could be available to consumers in the next three to six months. One important innovation of the new test is that it can be done at any point in time - even after food. Current saliva tests have not been considered reliable enough to roll out on a large scale, as the concentration of viral particles in saliva ""drops steeply"" after one eats or drinks, Dr Tng noted.
 For instance, the ability of other saliva ARTs to detect the Sars-CoV-2 virus after food is around 11.7 per cent to 23.1 per cent, he said.
 ""Therefore, saliva antigen rapid tests are usually reliable only when they are performed first thing in the morning, after an overnight fast and before breakfast or brushing teeth.
 ""This makes testing of saliva samples at other times of the day less reliable,"" he added.
 The scientists were able to remedy this using a two-stage process for the Pasport.
 Like most ARTs, Pasport uses nanoparticles to bind to the virus, but with a difference - an additional amplification mechanism is built into it such that it uses more nanoparticles in its test than other ARTs, said Dr Tng.
 This means the viral ""signal"" will be a lot stronger, allowing the Pasport to detect low viral loads, such as after a meal or drink, he added.
 To capture viral variants which may otherwise evade detection through testing, the researchers have another trick up their sleeve.
 Apart from using an antibody placed at the test line to capture viral proteins, just like in conventional ART kits, additional ACE2 proteins are used to capture the virus. The ACE2 protein is the entry point for the coronavirus to infect human cells.
 This is because viral variants may change their targeted protein structure, and may thus evade antibody detection, said Dr Tng.
 Professor Ooi Eng Eong, from the Duke-NUS emerging infectious diseases programme, said: ""As the virus evolves to become more infectious, like with Delta and Omicron, the evolution has to do with its ability to infect - and the key is through ACE2. So as the virus becomes more infectious, our test will work better.""
 Prof Ooi said that with such a saliva test, general practitioners would be able to administer it for early diagnosis of Covid-19, without having to send a test sample to the lab for processing.
 This could prevent people from developing severe Covid-19, he added, noting that many Covid-19 treatments have to be given in the early stages of infection for better results.",The Straits Times (Singapore),8-012-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999986767209225}",en,0.9999986767209225

December 12, 2021 Sunday","Since 2014, undergoing four-hour dialysis treatments three times a week had become a routine for Mr Law Leh Ping.
 But the 50-year-old technician no longer needs to go for dialysis after undergoing a simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant in April 2019. He is the first person in Singapore with Type 2 diabetes to go for such an operation.
 Mr Law, who was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in his 20s, required insulin injections in his 40s when his blood glucose level could not be controlled.
 Significant kidney function deterioration later meant he needed dialysis.
 ""It took up a lot of time, because I had to leave work early three times a week and rush for my dialysis.""
 He said: ""This meant that I also could not travel overseas for long periods of time. At most, I could take a day trip to Malaysia.""
 Diabetes is a condition where there is too much sugar in the blood, which is damaging to the body and can lead to heart disease, kidney damage and even blindness.
 Type 1 diabetes is genetic and unpreventable. It occurs because the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, a hormone that controls blood glucose levels.
 Type 2 is the most common form of diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin properly. Its most common cause is obesity and an inactive lifestyle.
 Mr Law's transplant was one of four SPK operations successfully done in a pilot pancreas transplant service started in 2012, as a collaboration between the transplant units of National University Hospital and Singapore General Hospital.
 The pancreas transplant service was approved as a national programme by the Health Ministry in April.
 Dr Hersharan Kaur Sran, said: ""Although most people on the wait list have Type 2 diabetes, many of them are not eligible for the simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant because they do not fit the criteria, which is they must be on insulin and not overweight.
 ""Some of them may also have other medical conditions which make them unfit for the transplant.""
 The senior consultant at the National University Centre for Organ Transplantation said Mr Law was deemed suitable as he was on insulin and his weight was stable.
 Mr Law said: ""The transplant was a rare opportunity. When I had to undergo frequent dialysis treatments, my children were really worried about me. Now, it feels like I was given a new life.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),11-012-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999962343514682}",en,0.9999962343514682
99,"National wait list set up for pancreas transplants; Such operations can improve severe diabetics' quality of life, reduce long-term complications
The Straits Times (Singapore)
December 12, 2021 Sunday","Patients who need a pancreas transplant will now be placed on a national wait list to get the operation, with Singaporeans and permanent residents eligible for subsidies under a new national programme.
 This will ensure that potential patients at all hospitals are identified and screened for pancreas transplant suitability.
 Those on the wait list can expect to wait around two years to receive a new pancreas.
 This organ produces insulin that helps control blood glucose levels.
 For severe diabetics who do not produce sufficient insulin, a pancreas transplant can improve their quality of life and reduce long-term diabetic complications such as kidney failure, blindness and stroke.
 After a successful transplant, the pancreas should be able to produce sufficient insulin to control the patient's blood sugar.
 The national programme was approved by the Ministry of Health in April, making Singapore the only South-east Asian country with a pancreas transplant service.
 The National University Hospital (NUH) and Singapore General Hospital transplant units first collaborated on a pilot pancreas transplant service in 2012.
 A pancreas transplant is most commonly performed with a kidney transplant, known as simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant, Associate Professor Tiong Ho Yee, director of the National Pancreas Transplant Programme, told the media yesterday.
 He explained that diabetes is a major cause of kidney failure.
 An SPK transplant improves the quality of life for diabetic patients compared with a kidney transplant alone, as they will no longer need to take regular insulin injections or undergo dialysis treatments, he said.
 ""This is the only treatment to establish normal sugar levels in patients with diabetes without the need for external insulin injections,"" said Prof Tiong.
 One SPK transplant has been performed since April, while four such operations were successfully carried out during the pilot.
 The national programme also offers pancreas-only transplants and pancreas after kidney transplants.
 About 19,000 people here are diagnosed with diabetes each year.
 According to the Singapore renal registry annual report 2019, diabetes is the number one cause of kidney failure here, accounting for about two in three new patients needing dialysis.
 Speaking at an event to mark World Diabetes Day on Nov 14, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said one in three individuals in Singapore is at risk of developing diabetes in their lifetime.
 ""If nothing is done, by 2050, it is estimated that about one million Singaporeans will be living with diabetes,"" said Mr Ong.
 Singaporeans and permanent residents are covered by the national programme, and eligible patients will benefit from Ministry of Health subsidies for the transplant operation, which will be carried out at NUH in the next two years.
 Without the subsidies, patients may have to fork out around $80,000.
 Mr Halim Anuwar was the first to undergo an SPK transplant under the national programme in July.
 The 39-year-old ambulance driver said: ""It was shocking and unexpected to receive the call from NUH that I could undergo the transplant.""
 He added: ""I'm recovering well now... I'm back at work. I no longer have to attend dialysis treatments and can now lead a normal life.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),11-012-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999971066945416}",en,0.9999971066945416

Raybe Oh's plight; Â· Chalked up over $538,000 in hospital bills Â· Endured 32 operations Â· Survived pneumonia
The Straits Times (Singapore)
December 12, 2021 Sunday","For four long months, Ms Raybe Oh Siew Huey fought for her life while warded in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) after suffering burns so severe she could not breathe on her own.
 At one point, the 26-year-old was stricken with life-threatening pneumonia and had to be intubated, leaving her unable to talk, drink or eat for six days while in the intensive care unit (ICU).
 ""When I was in the ICU, I really thought that I should just die, because it was too painful,"" said the former air stewardess and getai singer.
 Ms Oh had suffered burns to about 80 per cent of her body on Feb 13 this year while trying to rescue her 29-year-old fiance, Mr Jonathan Long, and their four friends, from a burning car. The BMW M4 had crashed into a shophouse in Tanjong Pagar.
 All five men died in the accident.
 Ms Oh was rushed to SGH and warded in the ICU, before her condition stabilised and she was moved to a high-dependency ward just over a week later.
 But her trials were far from over. She then spent months undergoing a total of 32 operations to clean her wounds and graft patches of skin all over her body.
 In a series of posts on Instagram in the early hours yesterday, Ms Oh said she was heartbroken when she saw her mother crying in the hospital.
 ""I told myself that I must be strong, to not let my mother suffer,"" she said.
 ""Each time I went for surgery, I held back my tears because I didn't want my mother to be hurt.
 ""But there were times when the pain was just unbearable and I cried, and my mother cried with me. It's really not been easy for her.""
 Speaking to The Sunday Times, Ms Oh said her mother has been her pillar of strength.
 ""I'm tough because I'm raised by a tough woman,"" she added.
 A video of the accident shows Ms Oh running to the car, which was engulfed in flames, in an attempt to save the men. She is then seen emerging from the inferno covered in flames and running towards shophouses across the road.
 Yesterday, she shared that she has no regrets trying to save her fiance. They were meant to celebrate their third year together in April this year.
 ""If I could turn back time, I would do it again,"" she said. ""I'm just feeling very sorry for my family for the pain they have to go through.""
 She told The Sunday Times that her relationships with her family and Mr Long's family have grown stronger since the accident.
 ""They are my pillar and strength to continue fighting,"" she said.
 ""My close friends are very caring as well. They always make time to accompany me to make sure I'm okay mentally.""
 Ms Oh said her respiratory tract was injured and she does not have the lung capacity to sing now.
 She said that her bill after being discharged in June amounted to more than $538,000, but the sum was largely covered by insurance.
 ""I'm super thankful to the nurses in SGH for taking excellent care of me,"" she said.
 ""And also not forgetting the doctors. The SGH plastic surgery department is the best in Asia. I fully trust and have faith in them.""
 Ms Oh is currently back in SGH, where she is warded for further treatment. She said she is expecting to spend a significant amount of time there over the next year with multiple reconstructive surgical operations scheduled.
 At present, she is undergoing flap surgery because of a thick scar on her hand which is affecting its function.
 ""It's a long, long recovery journey for me,"" she said.
 ""I want to thank everyone who has sent me well wishes and messages of encouragement. It's really heart-warming to receive so much love from complete strangers.""",,11-012-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999984668624822}",en,0.9999984668624822
101,"Age-related hearing loss common, but seniors don't seek help for it early
Channel NewsAsia
December 12, 2021 Sunday 6:00 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: When Ms Choy visited her parents in 2015 after moving out, she could hear the television blaring as she approached the flat from the lift.
That was the first telltale sign that something was wrong with her now 84-year-old father's hearing. She got him tested and found he had lost about 60 per cent of his hearing.
But when he saw the cost of hearing aids, he refused to have them fitted. This was despite Ms Choy insisting that she would pay for them.
""I assured him that the cost doesn't beat the quality of life that he'll get. I'm ready to pay all that's required,"" she said.
With her father not getting help, his hearing progressively got worse, said Ms Choy, a 40-year-old marketing executive.
""We needed to talk to him louder and louder, till we were shouting at him,"" she said. She also had trouble talking to him on the phone, as she would not be able to get a response from him despite speaking at her loudest.
He would eventually tell her to text him. Although he did not cut back on his social outings, like his weekly chess sessions with old friends, he resorted to getting them to write or text him instead of talking. When out, he would tell shopowners upfront that he could not hear, Ms Choy said.
Things changed earlier this year after he was referred to the Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery at National University Hospital (NUH). Ms Choy's father was then referred to the hospital's mobile hearing clinic, where he was assessed to have 80 per cent hearing loss and was fitted with hearing aids. Communication with him is easier now, Ms Choy said. And in October this year, at a family wedding, his relatives were able to have a conversation with him after a long time, she said.
""Whatever (level of) hearing comes along is a delightful surprise to us,"" she added.
UNADDRESSED HEARING LOSS AMONG THE ELDERLY
Her father's case is not uncommon.
Speaking at a media event in October to announce an innovation that allows seniors to have their hearing tested in the community, Professor William Hal Martin from NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine said that 93 per cent of seniors aged 60 years and above have some degree of hearing loss.
He was citing findings from Project Silver Screen, an initiative started in 2018 by the Ministry of Health and Temasek Foundation Cares to screen more seniors for hearing problems.
""What's probably more alarming is that 61 per cent of them failed the hearing screening, indicating or suggesting the presence of a significant hearing loss,"" said Prof Martin, who is from the Department of Otolaryngology. These seniors often do not seek help immediately - the average reported time from when a person has enough hearing loss to benefit from amplification and actually getting such help is at least 10 years, Prof Martin said.
Consequences of untreated hearing loss include decreased quality of life, depression, anxiety and paranoia, accelerated brain tissue loss and an increased risk of dementia, he said.
BARRIERS TO SEEKING HELP
Several barriers prevent people from seeking help, chief among which is that the elderly - especially in Asia - often think hearing loss is part of ageing and nothing can be done about it.
Some also worry about whether they can afford hearing aids.
But with means-tested government funding available, affordability is not an issue for most seniors, chief audiologist at NUH's Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Dr Jenny Loo said. Another barrier is access - not everyone knows where and how to seek help.
On that front, three community-based hearing clinics have been set up in Pioneer Polyclinic, Tiong Bahru Community Health Centre and Singapore General Hospital Sleep Centre.
The clinics use a new boothless method developed by the hearing research team at NUS Medicine. This allows hearing evaluation to be done anywhere, instead of only in a sound-insulated booth at a hospital.
Some elderly people also have the misconception that hearing aids do not work or are noisy, which discourages them from seeking help. Dr Loo said that while the old hearing aids were indeed noisy, new ones are ""quite crystal clear"".
Early detection and intervention are essential, she said. ""Otherwise the brain will start to forget how sounds are like, and it will be harder to intervene with hearing devices."" TREATMENT FOR HEARING LOSS
Ms Leem urged family members to encourage seniors to get their hearing checked if they show signs of hearing loss.
If diseases involving the ear or hearing are detected, medical intervention will be the first step. Otherwise, a hearing aid or cochlear implant is the solution, Dr Loo said.
""Most importantly, the medical team need to devise a customised plan based on patient's needs, degree of hearing loss and lifestyle,"" she said.
President of the Hearing Professionals Association Ronald Pang said that hearing aids are modelled for varied lifestyle needs. A senior who is not very mobile and wearing the aid primarily in a quiet home setting would benefit from a ""basic model"" that cost a ""few hundred dollars"".
More intelligent hearing aids designed for active retirees cost more, but can suppress noise better or have Bluetooth features linked to their mobile phones. Premium models also operate more effectively against echos and wind, Mr Pang said.
""The most expensive hearing aids in the premium range, designed for working adults and those with higher expectations, can cost more than S$7,000 each,"" he said.
Beyond getting fitted with hearing aids, it is important to maintain them and go for a follow-up within three months of being prescribed, said senior Ear, Nose and Throat specialist at Farrer Park Hospital Dr Soon Sue Rene.
Dr Soon also stressed that there needs to be more awareness about hearing loss.
""Hearing is important for healthy ageing. It shouldn't be the case that you are 60 or above 60, think hearing loss is normal and then wait again for years before it becomes moderate to severe to seek help,"" she said.
""That will be a bit too late because it comes with dementia, cognitive decline and social isolation."" INITIAL: ja(cy)",Channel NewsAsia,14-012-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999950975265139}",en,0.9999950975265139
102,"New bacteria species named after S'pore upon local discovery; Team of docs made discovery while analysing skin and wound samples
The Straits Times (Singapore)
December 15, 2021 Wednesday","An unexpected discovery by a team of doctors analysing skin and wound samples has led to a new species of bacteria being identified and named after Singapore.
 Staphylococcus singaporensis sp.nov (S. singaporensis) is part of the Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) complex, which commonly causes conditions from mild skin and wound infections to surgical and more serious bloodstream infections that may be fatal.
 The discovery was published in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology on Oct 26.
 This complex is a group of four different species, including S. singaporensis, that have a similar genetic make-up.
 Associate Professor Raymond Lin, director of the National Public Health Laboratory at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), said yesterday that everyone will likely be infected by S. aureus at some point in their lives.
 To isolate and identify the Singapore bacteria, research groups from the National University Hospital (NUH), NCID and Singapore General Hospital had studied bacteria isolates, which appeared related to S. aureus, between April 2019 and July 2019.
 Isolates are bacteria grown in a laboratory.
 Whole genome sequencing of the isolates was then performed and comparative genome analysis found that six out of the 43 of these isolates were quite different from other members of the S. aureus complex.
 These six isolates were confirmed to be a new species - the Singapore bacteria.
 ""This new species probably existed all along and nobody noticed it earlier,"" said Prof Lin, who is also the head and senior consultant in microbiology at the Department of Laboratory Medicine in NUH.
 Based on what is known so far, the new species is susceptible to commonly used antibiotics, unlike some S. aureus species that have developed multi-drug resistance.
 S. singaporensis also lacks many of the toxin genes frequently found in S. aureus.
 However, more data needs to be collected over time, both locally and globally, to fully understand the impact of the new species.
 Identifying a new species enables scientists to analyse and predict more precisely the outcomes of infections due to various species, Prof Lin added.
 Dr Chew Ka Lip, a consultant in microbiology at NUH's Department of Laboratory Medicine, added: ""There remains much to be done to understand the differences, if any, between these organisms in terms of clinical infections and prognosis.
 ""This could potentially lead to more tailored clinical care management of our patients to optimise outcomes.""
 All six isolates have also been deposited in international strain repositories.
   MORE TAILORED CARE There remains much to be done to understand the differences, if any, between these organisms in terms of clinical infections and prognosis. This could potentially lead to more tailored clinical care management of our patients to optimise outcomes.

103,"RSAF unveils new H225M helicopter with better range, manoeuvring to replace Super Pumas
Channel NewsAsia
December 15, 2021 Wednesday 5:25 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: It might look largely similar to its predecessor, the Super Puma, but the Republic of Singapore Air Force's (RSAF) new medium lift helicopter, the H225M, can fly better and farther.
The Airbus-made H225M can be used for search and rescue (SAR), aeromedical evacuation, as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. Reporters got a first up close and personal look at the helicopter at Sembawang Air Base on Wednesday (Dec 15).
""With its high load capacity, easy cabin access, combined with fast cruise speed, long range and in-flight agility, the H225M helicopter provides the flexibility needed for the RSAF to be more effective and capable in meeting operational demands,"" the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said in a fact sheet on Wednesday. The H225M payload capacity supports one of the following: About 30 personnel, 11 stretchers with medical support, or up to 4,750kg of underslung cargo. It can fly up to 740km before needing to refuel, about 20 per cent more than the Super Pumas, which have been in service since 1983.
MINDEF had announced in November 2016 that it will buy the H225Ms to replace the ageing Super Pumas, although the previously projected delivery of end-2020 was delayed to early 2021 onwards due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The new helicopter is part of the helicopter group under RSAF's Participation Command, which can insert troops, drop supplies or provide air defence to influence ground and maritime battles. Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Oh Chun Keong, 43, commander of the tactical air support group under the same command, said the RSAF will take delivery of the H225M in phases, according to operational requirements. Defense News reported in March that the final number will likely be around 30 helicopters.
""The Super Pumas have been serving as a workhorse of the RSAF over the last 30-over years. It's timely for us to renew our capabilities to future-proof ourselves,"" LTC Oh said, adding that most of the Super Puma's current missions will be transferred to the H225M.
Over more than three decades, the Super Pumas have participated in humanitarian missions locally and abroad, inserted special forces in counterterrorism exercises, and carried the state flag during the National Day Parade.
The H225M is still being operationalised, with the first batch of pilots and air crew specialists - all trained for the Super Puma - starting overseas flying training in early 2020 and is now training locally. There is no indication yet on when the helicopter will be fully operationalised.
BETTER RANGE AND MANOEUVRABILITY
But H225M pilot Captain (CPT) Darryl Chong, 26, said the new helicopter has already left a good first impression.
""There is greater flexibility for us to achieve our missions when there is longer range capability for the aircraft,"" he said. ""When we compare it to the Super Pumas, even though (the H225M) is more manoeuvrable, it's also more stable.""
CPT Chong said the H225M comes with a ""better version"" of everything the Super Puma has, including more reliable gyros that help manoeuvre the helicopter.
""We are trying to work the H225M into bettering existing processes,"" he added. ""The closest analogy I can give you is just like upgrading your car. Plain and simple, it's a better aircraft."" Besides flying, the H225M can also perform its missions more effectively. For instance, its extra hoist and longer cable come in handy during SAR missions.
A pair of hoists allow for redundancy when pulling up casualties, while a longer cable enables the helicopter to hover higher when faced with tall obstacles, like a ship's mast.
""The other thing is it has a new and improved motor, which actually gives us a faster winching speed,"" said 3rd Warrant Officer Dinesh Kumar Suppiah, 41, an air crew specialist with the H225M.
""When it comes to rescue, time is precious. And by having a faster winching speed, we are able to insert the winchman and extract the casualties in a very fast manner where every second counts.""
URGENT SEARCH AND RESCUE
On Wednesday, Senior Minister of State for Defence Heng Chee How watched a demonstration of how a time-critical SAR mission begins at the air base.
As a siren rang through the hangar, logistics personnel hurried out to a parked Super Puma before towing it out to the tarmac. In a nearby container, two pairs of pilots and air crew specialists on 24-hour standby geared up and sprinted out. The helicopter needs to be airborne within minutes. At a nearby medical squadron, a doctor and a medic rushed out in an ambulance with sirens blaring. The ambulance brought them to the helicopter, which by then had turned on its rotors.
The chopping sounds grew louder, the medical personnel boarded, and the Super Puma - painted in distinct red-and-white SAR colours - lurched forward, made a right turn and took off.
The helicopter sooon banked left and hovered close to the ground, and a crew member was winched down to raise a dummy casualty on a stretcher. The RSAF responds to an average of two SAR activations a month, including attending to merchant vessels with sick or injured crew in the South China Sea.
On Nov 26, a Super Puma was activated to evacuate a cruise ship crew member, who had suffered a heart attack, to Singapore General Hospital. Mr Heng, who also took part in a familiarisation flight on the H225M, said the new helicopter will ""more than well"" attend to the role of the Super Pumas.

  SAME DRUG COST MUCH MORE AT ANOTHER HOSPITAL  My uncle recently visited Ng Teng Fong General Hospital to buy 100mg of Sandoz Sildenafil, a prescription drug for erectile dysfunction.
 He was shocked to find out that a box of four tablets cost $9.12, since he had bought the same item for $3.96 at Sengkang General Hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Singapore General Hospital previously.
 I know the price can vary at different hospitals, but it is not reasonable for the same drug to cost so much more at one hospital.
 A price difference of 5 to 10 per cent would have been more acceptable.

 While people can make payment on both the HealthHub app and website, I have found that I am unable to retrieve the receipts of the transactions.
 This is a hindrance, especially when making claims to employers or insurance companies. Because of this, people may still prefer in-person payments to obtain a receipt.

105,"A&E fees raised at public hospitals
The Straits Times (Singapore)
December 17, 2021 Friday","Most public hospitals here raised fees for their emergency services earlier this year, as part of a periodic review to cope with rising costs. They now range from $116 to $132 for accident and emergency (A&E) attendances, up from $110 to $126 before charges were raised starting at the end of April.
 The fee is for a consultation with a doctor, as well as nursing care and treatment. It includes basic investigations such as urine or blood sugar tests, basic procedures such as putting on a plastic cast, simple suturing and wound dressing, and standard medication.
 A check online showed that Singapore General Hospital (SGH), National University Hospital (NUH) and Sengkang General Hospital charged $121 for A&E services last year, while Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) had a fee of $122. These four now charge $128. An A&E visit at Changi General Hospital (CGH) now costs $132, up from $126.
 The A&E fee at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH) and KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) was $120 last year and it is now $127. Only Tan Tock Seng Hospital's fee has been unchanged since 2019 at $128.
 At Alexandra Hospital (AH), patients now pay $116 for emergency services, up from $110 previously. Its walk-in 24/7 Urgent Care Centre handles medical emergencies but not major trauma cases like heart attacks or acute strokes.
 Public hospitals also raised their fees for other things, such as beds and consultations.
 A spokesman for the National University Health System (NUHS) said it made ""nominal fee adjustments"" to ward charges, services at specialist outpatient clinics, and the Emergency Department on April 28 at NUH, NTFGH, AH and Jurong Medical Centre.
 He said the cluster reviews charges periodically to take into account operating costs and inflation, adding: ""NUHS institutions had largely kept fees intact for the past years and any decision to revise fees is made only after careful consideration of patient impact.""
 Eligible patients will continue to be heavily subsidised by the Government, and assistance schemes are available for patients with financial difficulties.
 SingHealth's group chief financial officer, Mr Sia Kheng Hong, said its institutions made fee revisions ""to selected subsidised and private clinical services across different settings this year"". The hospitals that come under SingHealth are SGH, CGH, KKH and Sengkang General.
 ""This is part of our periodic review of fees,"" he said, explaining that it takes into account changes in operational, manpower and medicine costs.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
December 17, 2021 Friday","A man, now 30, refused to be intimate with his HIV-positive male friend - who was supporting him financially - and stabbed the 44-year-old victim after the older man decided to end their friendship.
 The victim needed a procedure to surgically remove a small part of his bowel as a result of the attack in 2018. The assailant cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the victim's identity.
 The Singaporean offender, who appeared in a district court via video link, was yesterday sentenced to nine years' jail, nine strokes of the cane and a fine of $3,600.
 He had pleaded guilty on Oct 28 to 10 charges, including voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a weapon, and various drug-related ones such as methamphetamine possession and consumption.
 He was also disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for a year for one count each of failing to stop after an accident and using a vehicle without insurance coverage.
 The two men had lived together from May 2018 in a rented condominium unit. On Aug 17 that year, the assailant had returned home with another man.
 The following night, he and the victim got into an argument over text messages. The victim decided he wanted to end their friendship and left the unit. But he returned at about 11pm that night, upon which the accused confronted him at the door and placed the pointed edge of a parang (a large knife) on the left of the victim's neck. The pair also argued about the victim's HIV-positive status and the assailant's refusal to be intimate with him.
 After about 10 minutes, they calmed down and the victim went to a bedroom and fell asleep.
 At around 4am, he woke up and noticed the younger man was not in the bedroom. He also realised his wallet, NRIC and laptop were missing. The victim panicked when he could not open the bedroom door and started kicking it, while shouting the assailant's name.
 He also accused the younger man of locking the door, Deputy Public Prosecutor Theong Li Han had said in earlier proceedings.
 The assailant then opened the door and stabbed his friend in the abdomen. The victim told the assailant to call for an ambulance. After the assailant did so, he left the unit with the weapon.
 At the Singapore General Hospital, the victim was determined to have penetrating injuries to his small bowel, requiring a small segment to be surgically removed. He later recovered.
 Offenders convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a weapon can be jailed for up to 15 years and fined or caned.",The Straits Times (Singapore),16-012-2021,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999980805078523}",en,0.9999980805078523

When I went to Singapore General Hospital's specialist department to seek treatment or remedy for my hearing loss, I was referred to the Centre for Hearing and Ear Implants, where I was advised to use a hearing aid.  I was shocked to be told that a pair of hearing aids would cost at least $3,000 and that the usual public subsidy (50 per cent off) and Pioneer Generation (PG) subsidy (another 50 per cent off) are not available for hearing aids.  Isn't the loss of hearing for an elderly person as normal as the loss of clear eyesight?  Why then are the usual government subsidies not applicable for a senior who needs a hearing aid?  The need for subsidies in the case of hearing aids is even more pressing given that it would cost the elderly, most of them retirees without income, at least $3,000 to purchase, and to subsequently replace every three to five years.  If the stated policy of the Government is to make healthcare affordable for all Singaporeans and our Pioneer Generation, shouldn't the public and PG subsidies be made applicable for hearing aids when doctors at public healthcare institutions have certified that seniors need them?

110,"Using smart glasses as a doctor's eyes and ears; Google Glass headset lets doctor in hospital join home visits virtually, get instant updates
The Straits Times (Singapore)
January 4, 2022 Tuesday","After renovation contractor Sulaiman Abu Bakar injured his spinal cord in a cycling accident in August last year, he could not move his legs.  The 48-year-old is undergoing rehabilitation at home to recover his motor functions. A nurse from Alexandra Hospital (AH), which is under the National University Health System, visits him at his home in Pasir Ris to check on him.  Usually, the nurse would have to return to the hospital after the home call to update a rehabilitation clinician on the patient's condition so that follow-up action can be taken. 
 But for Mr Sulaiman, this process has been shortened with the help of the Google Glass headset - a tool that acts as the doctor's eyes and ears, letting him join the visit virtually and be updated on the spot.  According to Google, AH is the first healthcare institution in Singapore and in the Asia-Pacific to use the device.  AH has been using the smart glasses - Google's Glass Enterprise Edition 2 - as a rehabilitation aid and in the hospital's emergency department since October last year.  The hospital has five such devices but plans to get three more, following positive feedback and more requests to use the smart glasses.  Dr Alexander Yip, the clinical director of AH's Health Innovation and Technology Office, said the Covid-19 pandemic ""has brought new challenges to the healthcare system and the strain on front-line workers has forced us to seek out solutions that can alleviate manpower demands"".  The hospital sought a smart glass solution to complement its existing telemedicine services. In February 2020, the hospital began offering video consultations to patients.  Telemedicine services have been on the rise here as Covid-19 made it more difficult for patients to visit clinics. Data from the Integrated Health Information Systems, the tech agency for public healthcare institutions, showed that only 1,947 patients from such institutions here used video consultation services between 2017 and the start of 2020. By October 2020, 24,227 patients had sought medical help via video consultations.  This appears to have continued into last year. National Healthcare Group (NHG) said that at the end of October 2020, more than 45 departments from its healthcare institutions were providing teleconsultation services. This grew to over 70 as at the end of September last year. Clinical pharmacists from NHG's Tan Tock Seng Hospital, for instance, conduct teleconsultations with patients regarding certain high-risk medications.  As for home visits by AH staff, a nurse wears the Google Glass device, which has a camera situated near the eyes and a microphone to pick up what the nurse hears. This allows a doctor in the hospital to use a computer to see and hear what the nurse is doing. This first-person view is harder to achieve with other devices, such as cellphones.  The clinician is also able to ask for more checks on the patient on the spot, if necessary, as the nurse can hear the doctor via the headset. The glasses also free the nurse's hands to examine the patient more easily.  ""It's very convenient,"" Mr Sulaiman told The Straits Times. ""I can ask the doctor questions and he can answer me.""  Dr Gobinathan Chandran, Mr Sulaiman's physician and an associate consultant for rehabilitation medicine at AH, said seeing the patient in real time makes a big difference in being able to decide how to help the patient further.  ""Seeing is very different from trying to imagine what the patient's situation or condition is,"" he said, adding that he can record the nurse's observations to save time and reduce recording errors.  AH's junior nurses in personal protective equipment (PPE) also wear the smart glasses when checking patients at the emergency department for Covid-19 symptoms. This allows senior nurses to see the patients remotely and supervise their younger colleagues without having to don PPE, again saving them time as resources are strapped amid the pandemic.  There are plans to extend the use of the glasses to help train new nurses at the hospital, such as by allowing them to see how procedures are done from a first-person point of view.  Other healthcare institutions are using gadgets similar to Google Glass for training but in a different way. For instance, since 2020, SingHealth has been using virtual reality (VR) headsets to train pharmacists at Singapore General Hospital due partly to Covid-19 making in-person training harder.  The healthcare group has a programme in which trainees don Meta's Oculus Rift S VR headset and navigate a virtual pharmacy environment. In it, they have to complete training tasks such as validating and processing prescriptions.

111,"Hospitals use charity funds to ease burden of needy patients; Items paid for include ambulance transport, interim dialysis services, medical devices and services to support patients at home
The Straits Times (Singapore)
January 4, 2022 Tuesday","Hospitals here have been helping financially strapped patients via their charity funds to pay for interim services such as ambulance transport and dialysis.  The National University Health System (NUHS), one of three public healthcare clusters in Singapore which the National University Hospital is part of, said eligible patients who are assessed to be in financial need may receive funding support for items not covered under MediFund.  Between April 2020 and March last year, the NUHS Fund helped 1,710 beneficiaries by providing more than $2.57 million in aid.  According to annual reports, in FY2019, the fund had disbursed $3.11 million and benefited 2,242 individuals. 
 NUHS said items paid for included wheelchairs, interim dialysis services and services to support patients at home after they were discharged, like cleaning services.  The KK Women's and Children's Hospital also has a fund which supports annually more than 400 vulnerable patients whose conditions vary in severity.  The KKH Health Fund helps patients with conditions such as chronic illnesses, cancer, gynaecological conditions and medically complex pregnancies.  The amount disbursed to these patients is more than $1 million annually and has remained fairly consistent over the years.  Ms Caroline Tham, head of the hospital's development department, said: ""Regardless of the severity of their conditions, each patient getting help has exhausted all other options of funding, leaving them in dire need for help.  ""With the financial burden of their medical expenses reduced, these patients can better focus on recovery. We invite you to partner us in supporting vulnerable children and women patients.""  Ms Leow Sok Fen, principal medical social worker of Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said the Covid-19 situation and travel restrictions have made it difficult for domestic helpers to enter Singapore.  And this has impacted patients who need to be cared for by such workers.  She said: ""Without financial assistance for these interim care services, needy patients who are fit for discharge will have to be in hospital for weeks and cannot go home.""  Interim caregiving services are provided by trained caregivers and help patients with daily activities such as feeding, personal care, vital-signs monitoring and taking medicine.  There was also strong demand for interim dialysis services, with more than half of Singapore General Hospital's (SGH) Needy Patients Fund last year going towards interim dialysis services for patients until they could find alternative financing solutions.  Last year, more than 2,030 patients benefited from the SGH charity fund, receiving about $1.3 million in assistance.  SGH said this was a more than 30 per cent increase in funds compared with 2020, when about $1 million was disbursed to support more than 2,000 patients.  The public can donate to the various funds listed above.  Ms Clara Lim, director of SGH's development office, said: ""There's no amount that's too small. For example, $100 will provide one month's supply of milk feeds for a patient on tube feeding.  ""We hope everyone can join us and help someone in need today.""  Mr Haizan Solhan, 61, who has multiple chronic conditions, including diabetes and end-stage renal disease, was a beneficiary of the SGH fund from December 2020 to February last year.  The father of two sons, aged 25 and 27, and a daughter, aged 30, had to quit his job in 2019 as a customer service worker as 12-hour shifts were too challenging for him.  He said: ""As the sole breadwinner of the family, it was too straining on my financial and mental well-being. I was quite worried and depressed during the period.""  His sons are in university and need some financial support for their daily expenses.  Dr Annabelle Chow, principal clinical psychologist at Annabelle Psychology, said: ""Knowing there are various avenues of help and that they can work with a medical social worker will help patients overcome the fear of not being able to afford the bill.""

112,"Covid-19 'virtual wards' allow more patients to recover at home
The Straits Times (Singapore)
January 5, 2022 Wednesday","Some hospitals here have been setting up Covid-19 ""virtual wards"" so that those whose conditions are stable, but who are ineligible for the home recovery programme, will also be allowed to recover in the comfort of their homes.  These patients include those who are unvaccinated, those on immunosuppressive medication and patients with chronic me-dical conditions.  The National University Health System's virtual ward has helped more than 500 Covid-19 patients so far, saving 3,500 bed days since September last year, said Dr Stephanie Ko, a consultant at the division of advanced internal medicine, at the National University Hospital's Department of Medicine.  The ward has also enrolled several Omicron cases, and it is ready to help with bed capacity if the Covid-19 surge hits, she told The Straits Times yesterday. 
 The treatment in the virtual ward is similar to that in a Covid-19 treatment facility or hospital - with doctors and nurses doing ""ward rounds"" daily or every other day through teleconsultation, and ensuring the patients measure their vital signs routinely, said Dr Ko.  The care team can also visit patients' homes if required - such as to administer drip-based medication to help high-risk Covid-19 patients reduce their risk of developing severe pneumonia, or to do blood tests.  ""In the Covid-19 virtual ward, our nurses teach patients how to monitor their own temperature, oxygen levels and blood pressure.  ""Patients with smartphones are enrolled for our vital signs chatbot, which reminds them to take these readings and submit them via an online form up to three times daily,"" she added.  Around half of the patients were referred from one of the cluster's three hospitals - National University Hospital, Alexandra Hospital or Ng Teng Fong General Hospital - after a period of hospital stay.  ""The other half were referred to us directly from community providers such as National University Polyclinics or the case management task group at the Ministry of Health, for patients who were at home and wished to continue recovery at home rather than go to a facility,"" said Dr Ko.  Such patients are either 80 years old and above and fully vaccinated, or more than 50 years old and not fully vaccinated, or have chronic medical conditions or weakened immune systems, such as patients who are on chemotherapy or have had organ transplants.  Some patients dying from Covid-19, but who wished to do so at home, have also been supported through the programme, she noted.  Similarly, the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), which set up its Covid-19 virtual ward on Oct 8, has enrolled 120 patients so far, said Dr Michelle Tan, the consultant in charge of the ward, and the head and consultant at the hospital's Department of Family Medicine and Continuing Care.  Patients are monitored remotely with the help of a messaging bot known as Doctor Covid, with which they are required to report their vital signs such as oxygen saturation levels, pulse rate and temperature three times a day, said Dr Tan.  Some patients may be required to take their blood pressure as well, and the necessary equipment can be loaned to those who need it, she added.  Those who are not tech savvy will have nurses calling them regularly to check their vital signs and to ensure that they are doing well at home, Dr Tan said.  The bot, co-developed by SGH, SingHealth and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, was initially used in migrant worker dormitories during the peak of the outbreak there in April 2020, and has been repurposed for the virtual ward, she noted.  Since rolling out the virtual ward, more than 800 bed days in the isolation ward have been saved, freeing up capacity for more patients, she added.  Noting that Singapore is bracing itself for a possible Omicron wave next month or in March, Dr Tan felt the virtual ward would play a ""very relevant role"" in such a scenario.  Currently, it has capacity for 100 patients at a time, though it has a surge capacity for up to 200 patients when needed, she added.",The Straits Times (Singapore),4-01-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999966881321669}",en,0.9999966881321669

January 13, 2022 Thursday","National shuttler Loh Kean Yew's cash rewards for winning the Badminton World Federation World Championships are now close to $500,000 as he received his single biggest incentive yet.  The Karim Family Foundation, which is set up by the family of Indonesian tycoon Bachtiar Karim and his wife Dewi Sukwanto, has given the Singaporean $200,000 to reward him for his exploits at the World Championships last month, and to urge him to continue pursuing his dream of winning an Olympic medal.  The foundation had contacted SPH Media Trust's Chinese Media Group to get in touch with the Singapore Badminton Association (SBA) in order to make the contribution last week.  Karim is ranked 10th on Forbes' list of Indonesia's 50 richest last year with a net worth of US$3.5 billion (S$4.72 billion).  He runs Musim Mas, an integrated palm oil firm, with his brothers Burhan and Bahari. 
 The 64-year-old is known for his philanthropy, with Musim Mas Holdings having gifted $2.27 million to Karim's alma mater, the National University of Singapore, to start a professorship in sustainability in its business school in 2010.  The company also donated $5 million to various causes, including the Singapore General Hospital and the Alzheimer's Disease Association - now known as Dementia Singapore - in 2020.

I have observed this young man for a long time now and I very much admire his indefatigable spirit.  ""We hope Kean Yew can continue playing good badminton without any worries. We want to show that it is good to pursue sports not just as a hobby, but also as a career. We hope more young aspiring athletes will follow in his footsteps so that Singapore's sporting standards can be raised.""  The Karims' gesture takes Loh's rewards kitty to over $496,000.  This includes money from a crowdfunding exercise initiated by Wei Chan, an SBA committee member, on a personal basis on Jan 2, which drew more than 700 donors who contributed over $166,000. Local business leaders and individuals, as well as SBA and its equipment and apparel sponsor Li-Ning have also chipped to the tune of $130,000.  The pot could increase to $1 million as The Straits Times understands that the SBA is in the midst of negotiating a multi-year, six-figure sponsorship deal.  Loh, who is currently competing at the India Open, said: ""I am very grateful to the many sponsors and well-wishers like Mr Karim who have offered various rewards and encouragement following my win. For athletes, this is a recognition of our hard work and sacrifices.  ""Doing my best and making my country proud has always been my priority. Knowing that there are many people out there who are very supportive, generous and encouraging towards local athletes means a lot to me.  ""There are too many people who have helped me in my life and I can never thank them enough. Without all the support and encouragement, I wouldn't be standing on the podium.""  The 24-year-old did not receive any prize money for winning the World Championships and he is also not eligible for the Singapore National Olympic Council's Major Games Award Programme as it applies only to the SEA, Asian, Commonwealth and Olympic Games.  SBA president Lawrence Leow was also encouraged by Karim's ""significant donation"" and the outpouring of support for Loh.  Noting that ""every source of encouragement"" is appreciated by the SBA, he said: ""With the continued support of Sport Singapore and sponsors, we are inspired and well-placed to groom more players to give Singaporeans more reasons to cheer in the coming years.""

January 15, 2022 Saturday","We thank Mr Tan Pin Ho for his feedback and we are sorry about his experience with the ambulance services used (Hefty bill for five-minute ambulance trip within hospital grounds, Jan 11).  Mr Tan, who was accompanied by his daughter, sought dental treatment at the National Dental Centre Singapore on Dec 29 last year. The planned dental procedure went well. 
 However, he started to develop symptoms of breathlessness, elevated blood pressure and heart rate while resting in the waiting area. Our care team attended to Mr Tan immediately and stabilised his condition in the treatment room.  To ensure that he was well and there were no other issues of concern, the care team assessed that it would be best for Mr Tan to be conveyed to Singapore General Hospital's A&E (accident and emergency) department for further management.  We sought consent from him and his daughter before we proceeded with the transfer, and an ambulance service was arranged.  As Mr Tan's condition had stabilised, a non-emergency private ambulance was called. We acknowledge that Mr Tan could have been conveyed through the hospital's medical transport service instead.

117,"New hub to train healthcare staff via use of serious games; Extended-reality tech simulates scenarios for them to hone critical thinking, practical skills
The Straits Times (Singapore)
January 19, 2022 Wednesday","A simulation training facility has been set up by SingHealth and Duke-NUS Medical School to hone and improve the skills of healthcare professionals with the help of serious games.  Known as the SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute of Medical Simulation (Sims) i3 Hub, the facility in Academia in College Road opened yesterday. It houses a wide range of extended-reality solutions - immersive technologies that can merge the physical and virtual worlds - and gaming equipment to facilitate learning. 
 Professor Chan Choong Meng, group chief education officer of SingHealth, said yesterday: ""A key benefit of incorporating serious games in healthcare training is the ability to simulate challenging scenarios for learners to practise critical thinking, decision-making and hone practical skills in a safe learning environment.""  Senior Minister of State for Health Koh Poh Koon said in his opening remarks at the launch of the hub that the incorporation of serious games in teaching enhances ""the breadth of healthcare simulation capabilities"", thereby offering more engaging and interactive learning opportunities that empower healthcare professionals to take increased ownership of their learning.  He noted that the Sims hub has developed 18 serious games that cover a wide variety of skills and knowledge across various healthcare professions.  Professor Fatimah Lateef, co-director of the SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute, said the hub is currently open to healthcare professionals from KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital, Singapore General Hospital and Changi General Hospital, which are all run by SingHealth.  She said the games fulfil unmet training needs among healthcare professionals.  One game, known as the Basic Cardiac Life Support Game, teaches learners to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and identify people who need it. The game allows healthcare professionals to refresh their CPR knowledge and skills remotely.  Developed by SingHealth Alice Lee Institute of Advanced Nursing, the game will be integrated into SingHealth's basic cardiac life support certification training this year. Up to 5,000 healthcare professionals are expected to be trained with this game in a year.  With these games, the duration for in-person, hands-on training is projected to be reduced by about 25 per cent, saving manpower and cost.  Another game, developed by Singapore General Hospital's department of internal medicine, is aimed at training healthcare professionals to manage septic shock.  Septic shock is a life-threatening condition usually caused by bacterial infection and can lead to a patient's blood pressure dropping to a dangerously low level.  The game recreates such a scenario through virtual reality for doctors to practise critical decision-making without posing a risk to actual patients.  Examples of other games include one that teaches users how to dispense medicine in a pharmacy properly, another on magnetic resonance imaging safety, and one that allows users to play the role of a decontamination team member responding to a disaster.",The Straits Times (Singapore),18-01-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999978928377153}",en,0.9999978928377153

Channel NewsAsia
January 19, 2022 Wednesday 12:55 PM GMT","SINGAPORE: Five people were taken to hospital for smoke inhalation after a fire broke out in a Housing Board flat in Jurong West early on Wednesday morning (Jan 19).
The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted to the fire at Block 723, Jurong West Ave 5 at about 6.10am.
The fire was in a unit on the third floor of the block and involved ""the contents of a living room"", SCDF said in a Facebook post.
Preliminary investigation shows that the fire originated from the battery pack of a power-assisted bicycle - otherwise known as a PAB or an e-bike. The battery was being charged at the time of the fire, said SCDF.
RESIDENTS EVACUATED BEFORE SCDF ARRIVED
There were six people in the flat when the fire broke out, all of whom had evacuated before SCDF arrived. Five of them were taken to Singapore General Hospital for smoke inhalation, said SCDF.
About 45 people from neighbouring units had also evacuated before SCDF arrived, it said.
The fire and was extinguished with one compressed air foam backpack, said SCDF.
""SCDF would like to remind the public on the prevention of PMD/PAB fires, including not to charge batteries for an extended period of time or overnight. Do not buy or use non-original batteries.""
In October, a 22-year-old man died and another was injured after a fire involving a PMD broke out in a flat at another HDB block in Jurong West.

119,"S'pore researchers conducting trials of drug to treat dengue
The Straits Times (Singapore)
January 19, 2022 Wednesday","Researchers here are conducting clinical trials on a first-of-its-kind drug which, if successful, could treat dengue.  Professor Jenny Low, deputy clinical and scientific director at the SingHealth Investigational Medicine Unit (IMU), which is running the trials, told The Straits Times yesterday that there is currently no drug to treat dengue specifically.  Instead, treatment focuses on supporting patients and treating the symptoms of dengue, such as fever and pain. 
 The new experimental drug works by preventing two proteins from the dengue virus - known as NS3 and NS4B - from interacting.  These proteins play a key role in allowing the virus to reproduce, said Prof Low, who is also senior consultant at Singapore General Hospital's Department of Infectious Diseases.  ""When dengue gets into our blood through an infected mosquito, it will attack our immune cells and start to multiply.  ""So we hope the drug will stop the virus from multiplying, attacking more and more cells, causing damage to various organs... and resulting in complications we see in acute dengue infection.""  Typical symptoms of dengue include fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting and mild bleeding from the nose or gums.  In rare cases, dengue may progress to dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome, which can lead to death.  The drug, which has a compound name of JNJ-64281802, was developed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and data on how it works was first published in scientific journal Nature on Oct 6 last year. It is administered orally in liquid form for five days, and is meant to be used as an intervention in the early stages of dengue.  The study, named Deng-I, will see 150 participants who are confirmed to be infected with dengue receiving standard treatment for the virus.  For five days, half of them will be given the new drug, while the other half will be given a placebo. They will be monitored to see how their conditions progress.  Prof Low said all patients in the study will be reimbursed for their time and will receive the best current standard of care, regardless of whether they are given the placebo or drug.  Participants must be aged 21 to 55, have symptoms appearing no more than 48 hours before they enrol in the trial, and must not be pregnant.  Those who wish to participate may contact SingHealth IMU on 9622-5342, or send an e-mail to imu@singhealth.com.sg  Prof Low said it is hard to tell when the drug will be ready, but noted that Covid-19 has shown that the process of developing new drugs can be streamlined and accelerated.  She added that if all goes well, the drug could possibly be ready in three to five years.  ""Dengue will never go away. If anything, our problem with dengue will only get worse because of global warming and urbanisation,"" she said.  In 2020, Singapore saw its largest dengue outbreak, with 35,315 infected and at least 29 dying from the disease.  Prof Low added: ""It's not a trivial disease, and the faster we get a therapeutic to treat dengue, the better it will be for Singapore and the rest of the region.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),18-01-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999966256327674}",en,0.9999966256327674
120,"Healthcare workers have carried the can in pandemic fight: Ong
The Straits Times (Singapore)
January 21, 2022 Friday","In a new book about Singapore's fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung turns to football to explain why he prefers to call healthcare workers ""the last line of defence"" rather than ""front-liners"".  ""There are games where everybody just attacks and you're the only one left, and at every counter-attack, you feel overwhelmed.  ""I thought that must be what a healthcare worker felt at that time,"" said Mr Ong in a chapter titled ""Battle in the hospitals"", where he talked about October last year when the Delta variant led to over 3,000 virus cases daily and the death toll climbed.  ""The rest of the society wants to move on but they were carrying the can.""  Mr Ong's interview appears in the book In This Together: Singapore's Covid-19 Story, published by Straits Times Press. 
It lays out in 13 chapters Singapore's multifaceted fight against the virus.  The chapter in the new book, which was launched yesterday, relates how the healthcare sector had to shoulder the lone, massive responsibility of treating and caring for the infected from the moment the virus arrived in January 2020 - at least until the home recovery scheme started late last year.  Healthcare workers such as nurses also share stories about managing anxious and distraught family members who were kept away from their loved ones, of being shunned by the public, and of feeling helpless and overwhelmed when patients died.  When the Delta variant began wreaking havoc from August last year, healthcare staff had no time to rest.  Singapore General Hospital assistant nurse clinician Chester Chow, 32, recalls in the book how he could be in a room with a critically ill patient for up to three hours, carrying out one procedure after another.  Sometimes, family members would take out their frustrations on the staff.  ""At different points in time, some of us wanted to give up,"" Mr Chow told journalists from The Straits Times. ""But we talked, supported and encouraged one another.""  Paranoia over healthcare workers being contaminated with the virus also spilled over at the initial stages of the pandemic, causing some to avoid wearing their uniforms while taking public transport.  National University Hospital senior staff nurse Nathanael Tan was in regular clothes when he hailed a taxi to work one day.  Yet, he was quizzed by the driver on why he was going to the hospital's emergency department before the cabby allowed him to board. The cabby kept his windows down the entire trip, said Mr Tan, 30.  The number of abuse or harassment cases reported by public healthcare workers rose from 1,200 in 2019 to 1,400 as at the end of November last year, while 1,500 workers resigned in the first half of last year, compared with 2,000 annually before the pandemic.  But Singaporeans have by and large rallied behind healthcare workers, with recovered patients interviewed for the book expressing appreciation for and recognition of them as heroes of the pandemic.  The private healthcare sector also chipped in to alleviate the burden on public institutions.  In January 2020, IHH Healthcare Singapore, the largest private group here, was called on to set up screening for travellers at 10 land and sea checkpoints within 24 hours.  The group tapped its pool of over 5,000 employees to man the checkpoints, with chief operating officer Noel Yeo doubling up as a temperature screener as well as a medical doctor assessing cases, he reveals in the book.  IHH's Mount Elizabeth Hospital also took in Covid-19 patients and provided manpower to take swab samples at worker dormitories, and to staff the community care facility at Singapore Expo.  IHH and other private medical groups were also roped in for the national vaccination programme, and when infections spiked last year, IHH provided laboratory testing services.  Once some teething problems were sorted out, the home recovery scheme also eased the strain on the healthcare system, and is now the default for most patients with no or mild symptoms.  In the book, a social worker who gave her name only as Charlyn recounted some of the ""logistical acrobatics"" behind recovering at home.  Throughout her 10-day isolation, the 35-year-old tried to stay in her bedroom as much as possible, to avoid putting her parents, grandfather and domestic helper at risk.  She would step out to shower and then disinfect the ceiling, walls and floor of the bathroom while nursing a fever and a splitting migraine.  ""I would be panting and sweating when I reached my bedroom,"" she said.  Charlyn also used her grandfather's commode to relieve herself in her room, saying: ""It was initially uncomfortable but I got used to it.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),20-01-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999957804398178}",en,0.9999957804398178
121,"SingHealth Tower and Outram Community Hospital officially opened
Channel NewsAsia
January 24, 2022 Monday 1:59 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: The SingHealth Tower and Outram Community Hospital were officially opened on Monday (Jan 24).
Located on the campus of Singapore General Hospital (SGH), the SingHealth Tower ""plays a central and strategic role for the SGH campus"", Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a speech at the opening ceremony on Monday.
The tower houses key facilities, such as the central kitchen and sterile supplies unit, that support the day-to-day running of SGH and other institutions on campus. A logistics hub and administrative staff offices are also located in the 19-storey building.
""These are the silent workers, always in the background. They are essential to any organisation, any campus,"" Mr Ong said.
""However, in this age of social media and round the clock running of the publicity machinery, we can easily forget their vital contribution, until something goes wrong. I am glad SingHealth has now provided them with a more pleasant and conducive work environment.""
The 545-bed Outram Community Hospital (OCH) is located in the SingHealth Tower, which ""helps ensure integrated and seamless care across the acute and community hospital on this campus"", Mr Ong said.
""We are deeply thankful that OCH opened in November 2019, just before our nation was struck by COVID-19,"" he added.
""As a result, SingHealth could use OCH wards to augment bed capacity whenever there was a surge in COVID-19 cases.""
It has also supported the operations of Bright Vision Community Hospital since it was converted to a COVID-19 treatment facility, he said.
While most COVID-19 patients recover well at home, a ""small group"" of recovered patients who are elderly and frail with existing medical conditions need rehabilitation and care at community hospitals, Mr Ong noted.
""Community hospitals have always played an important role in our public healthcare system in helping patients to recover, rehabilitate and reintegrate into the community,"" he said.
OCH is Singapore's ninth community hospital, and one of three under SingHealth. It offers programmes and activities that are designed to keep elderly patients mentally and physically engaged during their stay.
One such programme that will be rolled out in the OCH will equip patients there with essential skills, such as knowing how to use a smartphone and applications such as WhatsApp or QR code scanning.
""These skills will help the patients connect with their friends and loved ones, and lead a meaningful and active life after discharge,"" Mr Ong said.
OCH also offers inpatient hospice palliative care services for those who cannot be cared for at home.
""The palliative care team offers assistance to alleviate symptoms, and also attends to the patient's psychosocial needs, enabling them to live out their final days in dignity and with comfort,"" Mr Ong said.
For those who prefer to remain at home, OCH also offers a day hospice service run by HCA Hospice Care. It is the first day hospice to be co-located in a community hospital.
SGH CAMPUS DEVELOPMENT TO TAKE ABOUT 15 YEARS
The SGH Campus master plan was announced in 2016. Since then, the campus has been undergoing major development to improve its facilities and enhance capacity for growing healthcare needs, Mr Ong said.
Phase one of this master plan includes the OCH. Other key developments include the new National Cancer Centre, which is slated to open later this year, and the Emergency Medicine Building, which will open progressively from 2024.
This will be followed by the new SGH Elective Care Centre and National Dental Centre, scheduled to reopen by 2027.
The total development budget for Phase One is about S$4 billion, Mr Ong noted.
Phase Two of the master plan will see the development of a new SGH complex and an improved internal road network, Mr Ong said.
""All these are part of the Government's continuous investment in public infrastructure, for the benefit of Singaporeans,"" Mr Ong said, adding that the entire project is expected to take about 15 years or so to complete.
""Beyond the investment of resources, the entire project requires very meticulous planning and execution,"" he said.
""For example, services and roads need to be carefully shifted so as not to disrupt operations in one of the busiest and oldest hospitals in Singapore.
""Further, SGH is now 200 years old, and we are taking great efforts to preserve its heritage features and structures, such as the clock tower in Bowyer Block. The College of Medicine and Tan Teck Guan buildings, where my office is, will certainly also be preserved.""

122,"Gastric erosion: How a Nobel Prize winner gave me a new life ScienceTalk; I suffered from condition for a decade, until a scientist's research established the culprit
The Straits Times (Singapore)
January 24, 2022 Monday","The Straits Times article ""Nobel laureate Barry Marshall drank bacteria culture in 1984 to prove link to gastric ulcer"" published last Monday brought back a flood of memories.
1984 was a pivotal year in my life. That was when I almost died at age 14 from bleeding duodenal ulcers. They are the ""neighbours"" of gastric ulcers, located in the duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) instead of the stomach.
I lapped up every word in the article, especially the research Professor Marshall did in the 1980s to challenge the prevailing dogma - that gastric ulcers were linked to stress and lifestyle choices - and prove that the spiral-shaped Helicobacter pylori bacterium was significant in causing the disease.
Helicobacter pylori. Stomach acid. Biopsies. These terms were all too familiar to me.
About 30 per cent of the population in Singapore are infected with the bacteria, and many people may not even be aware of it if they are asymptomatic.
In 1983, Prof Marshall - then a young doctor in Australia - and his research partner Robin Warren tried to convince the medical world that the bacteria could be cancer-causing but no one believed them. They were ticked off at a gastroenterology meeting and told it was ""shameful"" to produce research like this.
But the Australian scientist persisted and established the link between the bacteria and gastric ulcers. This important discovery paved the way for a targeted treatment to kill the bacteria, which has changed the lives of so many gastric patients, including mine.
Prof Marshall and Dr Warren received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2005.
""So this is the man who gave me a new life,"" I thought.
Following the public humiliation at the medical convention, Prof Marshall decided to take matters into his own hands. He drank a culture of the H. pylori bacteria and developed gastritis shortly after. Left untreated, gastritis could lead to gastric ulcers. He biopsied himself and, sure enough, found that the bacterium was the underlying cause of his ulcer.
That was a major turning point of this groundbreaking research in 1984.
Over in Singapore that same year, I encountered a turning point in my life too. A twig passing off as a teen, I was underweight, weak and feeling tired all the time.
   I was put on what was called a triple therapy - taking a stomach acid blocker and two antibiotics for two weeks. I developed rashes towards the end of the treatment and did not complete the cycle, but subsequent tests showed that more than 90 per cent of the bugs had been evicted from my body.
And just like that, I was well. No more pain. No more regular check-ups or hospital stays. No more uncomfortable endoscopies. No more yucky medicine. No more fear of black stools. No more lying in bed at night worried about dying of gastric cancer.
   Walking even short distances left me breathless. Climbing stairs gave me palpitations. I nearly passed out on the school bus once.
The final warning sign came when I started passing stools that were black as charcoal. Being young and ill-informed, I had no idea what that meant. But when I told my mother, her face fell.
My father had the same symptoms when he had duodenal ulcers in the 1960s. He became so ill from the internal bleeding that doctors had to remove half his stomach. This was two years before I was born.
My parents took me to our family doctor, who did not believe me when I told him I had black stools.
""How black'"" he asked suspiciously.
I pointed at his blood pressure device, which was, well, black.
""Impossible,"" he retorted, then sent me home with some iron tablets.
For the next two days, I languished in bed, drifting in and out of sleep. Alarmed, my mother took me to another doctor who told her to rush me to the hospital.
By then, my condition had deteriorated further and I suddenly found myself being wheeled to the intensive care unit of Singapore General Hospital after a long wait at the accident and emergency department.
It was a Saturday night, but the hospital recalled their most senior consultant to give me an emergency endoscopy to see what was going on inside my gut.
The doctor emerged from the procedure and bluntly announced in Mandarin to my parents: ""Your daughter has many holes in the stomach. Seven or eight holes. All bleeding. Let's see if she can pull through tonight. You must be prepared.""
I did pull through, of course, but only after I received seven bags of blood over six days. I was told I had lost nearly half the blood in my scrawny body and it was a wonder I managed to hang on for so long.
There was another mystery the medical team could not solve: Why did a 14-year-old girl who did not smoke or drink end up with so many bleeding duodenal ulcers'
This was still 1984, before Prof Marshall could convince the world that some sneaky bacteria could wreak so much havoc in a person's gut. There was no way anyone could have known that my father probably still harboured the bacteria and most likely had passed them to me.
But there was one ""tell-tale sign"" (or so they thought) in my background - my school. I think the doctors were probably relieved when I told them I was from St Nicholas Girls' School.
""Oh, must be stress then."" It did not help that I was constantly begging them to discharge me as I did not want to miss the year-end exams.
My gastric erosion hit me again in 1985 and 1987. As I knew by then what symptoms to look out for, these episodes were less severe.
I had transferred to National University Hospital and became quite popular among the medical students and trainee doctors making their rounds due to my medical history and young age. Naturally, the ""stress"" factor was a constant refrain.
""Hwa Chong? Must be very stressful."" Actually I was having a ton of fun with extra-curricular activities but the doctors did not need to know that, so I just nodded my head solemnly.
When I made it to the National University of Singapore, my doctor suggested that I continue taking preventive medicine so that my studies would not be disrupted by what was then still regarded as a chronic disease.
A few years passed uneventfully for me, save for the usual gastric pain. For Prof Marshall and his colleagues, the early 1990s were crucial years spent looking for the best treatment for H. pylori.
During a routine check-up, my doctor told me that researchers had found that a bacterium was the culprit responsible for my suffering for almost a decade and there was now a cure for it.
""Oh, so it's not stress'"" Great. What excuse can I use in future for not working hard'
I was put on what was called a triple therapy - taking a stomach acid blocker and two antibiotics for two weeks. I developed rashes towards the end of the treatment and did not complete the cycle, but subsequent tests showed that more than 90 per cent of the bugs had been evicted from my body.
And just like that, I was well. No more pain. No more regular check-ups or hospital stays. No more uncomfortable endoscopies. No more yucky medicine. No more fear of black stools. No more lying in bed at night worried about dying of gastric cancer.
Yes to living again, thanks to the Australian doctor who would not give up.
I know people who are sceptical about modern medicine. ""What do doctors know'"" a friend asked me.
Yes, doctors do not know everything. But that is what inspires professionals like Prof Marshall to try doggedly to look for more answers, even if it meant drinking the very thing that he would like to kill.
Otherwise, I might still be fielding questions from puzzled doctors on my 18th relapse.

January 25, 2022 Tuesday","After two years in operation - during which it helped to bolster Singapore's hospital bed capacity when Covid-19 cases surged - the Outram Community Hospital (OCH) was officially opened yesterday.
It is part of a $4 billion, 20-year revamp of buildings on the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) campus, and occupies six floors in the new SingHealth Tower, also officially opened yesterday.
""Every building that comes online brings with it new infrastructure... and more importantly, our opportunity to transform care,"" SingHealth chief executive Ivy Ng said at the opening ceremony.
""The more complex care becomes, the more simple it has to be for patients to navigate through our system.""
The new National Cancer Centre Singapore is slated to open later this year as part of the revamp, with SGH's Emergency Medicine Building to start operations from 2024.
This will be followed by the SGH Elective Care Centre and National Dental Centre Singapore in 2027, with a second phase involving the addition of a new SGH Complex and an improved road network.
These developments are part of the Government's continuous investment in public infrastructure, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who attended the event in person.
""Beyond the investment of resources, the entire project requires very meticulous planning and execution. For example, services and roads need to be carefully shifted so as not to disrupt operations in one of the busiest and oldest hospitals in Singapore,"" he said.
The new 545-bed community hospital will look after patients who no longer need the acute care provided by a general hospital, but are not well enough to return home.
These include those who have undergone knee replacements, or had hip fractures or strokes. They can also include Covid-19 patients who have recovered from the virus but are elderly and frail, with existing medical conditions that require rehabilitation.
To help in their recovery, OCH has a special facility set up to mimic a two-room flat, allowing patients to practise performing daily activities.
The community hospital also takes in patients who require palliative care and those with dementia.
Also housed in the 19-storey SingHealth Tower are SGH's administrative and logistics staff, as well as the hospital's central kitchen and sterile supplies unit - from which food and medical supplies are delivered to the rest of the complex via a network of underground tunnels.

January 25, 2022 Tuesday","A man who was sentenced to three weeks' jail last April after he verbally abused a public servant continued committing similar offences just months later following his release.
On three separate occasions between September and November last year, Chandrasegaran Raman yelled vulgarities at an auxiliary police officer, a Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) sergeant and an SBS Transit station master. He also uttered a racial slur at the sergeant.
He also committed other offences after his earlier release, including failing to wear a mask properly while boarding a public bus.
The 54-year-old Singaporean was yesterday sentenced to 12 weeks' jail and a fine of $2,000. He pleaded guilty to six charges including three counts of harassment.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Gabriel Choong said that on Aug 22 last year, Chandrasegaran was seen wearing a mask below his chin while boarding bus service 21. He complied when the driver asked him to wear it properly.
The DPP said: ""The accused then began speaking incoherently to the victim. The victim attempted to converse with him, but subsequently decided to call the SBS Transit Control Centre for assistance which, in turn, called the police.
The following month, he was consuming beer alone when he developed chest pains. An ambulance took him to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) where he became uncooperative with staff and repeatedly asked them to release him so he could go for a smoke. They allowed him to leave around 2am.
An auxiliary police officer was escorting him to a drop-off point when Chandrasegaran abused him with vulgar language.
On Oct 31 last year, Chandrasegaran was drunk when he went to a police post in Jalan Bukit Merah and complained of chest pains. An SCDF sergeant arrived around 11pm and Chandrasegaran insisted on going to Tan Tock Seng Hospital even though SGH was nearer. He later verbally abused the officer, using vulgar language.
Two days later, an intoxicated Chandrasegaran approached a station master at Farrer Park MRT station and claimed that he had misplaced his mobile phone in a taxi.
DPP Choong told the court: ""The accused was unable to describe the taxi and insisted that the victim call the investigation officer in charge of the accused's earlier offences. The victim suggested that he go to a police station.""
Chandrasegaran scolded the man and directed an obscene word at him. The victim alerted the police and Chandrasegaran was charged in court later.",The Straits Times (Singapore),24-01-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999944243619603}",en,0.9999944243619603

The Straits Times (Singapore)
January 25, 2022 Tuesday","The family of the 11-year-old twins who were found dead in a canal in Upper Bukit Timah bade them an emotional farewell as they were cremated yesterday evening.
Mr Fong Chun Cheong, the funeral director of Singapore Yin Feng Shui Funeral Services, told The Straits Times that nearly 30 family members and friends, which is the cap for attendees under current Covid-19 restrictions, attended the cremation service.
""The family were emotional as they said goodbye to the boys,"" added Mr Fong, who previously said that he is a family friend.
At around 7.45pm, two hearses bearing the portraits of Aston Yap Kai Shern and Ethan Yap E Chern arrived at Mandai Crematorium.
One of the photos showed the back view of a boy. The other was the side view of a boy with the setting sun in the background.
Earlier, at around 7.15pm, a white Nissan car, believed to be ferrying the older sister of the twins, was seen entering the crematorium.
The twins were cremated at about 9pm, following a Buddhist prayer service at 8.15pm.
Mr Fong said they were cremated at the same time.
""I hope the public can share their prayers for the boys. The family also hope the public will not speculate so they can be given some peace and space during this time.""
Ethan and Aston were said to have special needs and were believed to be pupils of a school in the Eng Kong estate area.
Their bodies were released to the family yesterday afternoon.
At about 2pm, their sister was seen arriving at the mortuary at the Singapore General Hospital.
Dressed in a black top and pants and carrying two black bags, the woman, who is believed to be in her 20s, stared blankly ahead as she entered the premises.
Almost an hour later, another woman, whom ST understands to be a relative, got out of a white Nissan car and entered the mortuary.
Shielded by auxiliary police officers, the women got into the Nissan at about 3.15pm and left.
Shortly after, two white vans carrying the brothers' bodies exited the mortuary.
Mr Fong told ST in Mandarin: ""The family are still in shock and unable to accept this reality."" He added that the boys' parents are ""good and well respected people"".
Last Saturday, the police said they had received a call for help on Friday at 6.25pm from the twins' father, who was at a playground in Greenridge Crescent.
His sons were later found lying motionless in a nearby canal. They were pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic.
Yesterday morning, Xavier Yap Jung Houn, 48, was charged with the murder of Ethan.
Only one charge was tendered in court yesterday. The offence of murder carries the death penalty.",The Straits Times (Singapore),24-01-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999958840216902}",en,0.9999958840216902
126,"Man jailed for driving car into fellow deliveryman, causing fall and wrist fracture
Today (Singapore) - Online
January 27, 2022 Thursday","SINGAPORE - When a motorcyclist wanted food deliveryman Kong Tong Ngok to move his car away from the roadside, Kong refused because he thought that the food he was meant to collect for delivery would be ready soon. Kong then thought that the rider was taking a photo of his car to send to the Traffic Police, which would result in a summons and fine. He drove his car forward and collided with the rider, who fell and fractured his right wrist after landing on it. For what he did, Kong, 64, was on Thursday (Jan 27) jailed four weeks and banned from driving all classes of vehicles for 18 months. 
He began serving his sentence immediately. The former food deliveryman pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt to Mr Mohd Ali AS Shahul, 58, by a rash act. Mr Ali, who was also a delivery driver at the time, was riding along Kadayanallur Street in Tanjong Pagar around noon on June 9, 2020, when he noticed that the street was clogged with traffic. The congestion was due to several cars parked at the side of the road. Mr Ali then saw that the opposite lane was clear, except for Kong's stationary car. He alighted from his motorbike and approached Kong with the intention of asking him to move forward and not block the road. Kong, who parked there to collect food for delivery, did not wind down his driver's side window and continued to ignore Mr Ali when the latter gestured at him to drive off from the spot. Mr Ali then walked to the front of the car and took out his mobile phone to take a photo. Before he could do so, Kong drove forward. Mr Ali extended his hand towards the car bonnet to protect himself, but Kong continued moving forward and collided with him. Mr Ali fell to the ground from the impact. A Certis Cisco security officer who was stationed at the nearby Central Provident Fund Maxwell Service Centre called the police. Mr Ali went to the Singapore General Hospital for medical treatment, where an X-ray showed a wrist fracture. He was given 14 days of hospitalisation leave and a follow-up appointment at the hospital. When District Judge Kamala Ponnampalam asked if Mr Ali had made a full recovery, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Yohanes Ng said that the prosecution had not checked on this. DPP Ng, who sought three to four weeks' jail, also said that Kong was given two compounded fines for other traffic offences in 2020 - S$400 for beating a red light in February that year and S$200 for speeding in July that year. In mitigation, Kong's lawyer Tang Gee Ni said that his client thought Mr Ali would be sending the photo of his car to the Traffic Police. Mr Tang added: ""The accused decided to drive off, not wanting to get a summons and pay a fine, which he could ill-afford. He drove off very slowly, thinking the victim would step away. It was apparent that his judgement was erroneous. ""To the best of the accused's belief, the contact between his vehicle and the victim was slight or minimal."" The lawyer added that Kong had also apologised to Mr Ali in his police statements and said that he was ""sorry for any mistake I made"", which was an early indication of his remorse. Mr Tang noted that Kong's wife initiated divorce proceedings last year and Kong was unable to work because of his ill health. This included epileptic seizures and frequent fainting spells. In sentencing Kong, District Judge Ponnampalam said that it was fortuitous that Mr Ali did not sustain more serious injuries. ""There was absolutely no excuse for you to drive forward when he was in the path of your car,"" the judge added. Kong then replied: ""Yes, Your Honour, I'm sorry."" For causing grievous hurt by a rash act, he could have been jailed for up to four years or fined up to S$10,000, or punished with both.",Today (Singapore) - Online,27-01-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999971225925257}",en,0.9999971225925257

Channel NewsAsia
January 28, 2022 Friday 2:13 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: The founder of Healing the Divide, a group with a known stance against vaccination, had her charge upgraded on Friday (Jan 28) to a more serious one of conspiring to lie to the Ministry of Health (MOH).
Iris Koh Shu Cii, 46, was first charged on Sunday with one count of conspiring with doctor Jipson Quah to cheat MOH into believing that people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine.
The maximum penalty for this charge is three years' jail, a fine, or both.
On Friday, Koh received a more serious charge of criminal conspiracy to give a false representation to MOH.
She is now accused of being party to a criminal conspiracy with Quah between July 2021 and January 2022.
According to the charge sheet, she and Quah agreed to dishonestly make false representations to MOH that people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine, when they were not, in order to obtain COVID-19 vaccination certificates for these people.
The new charge is punishable by up to 20 years' jail, a fine, or both.
Koh is currently warded at Singapore General Hospital, according to court records, and will be remanded again once she is discharged.
Her lawyer, Clarence Lun of Fervent Chambers, told CNA that his team was preparing an application to the High Court to reverse the no-bail condition that Koh is currently under.
It is Koh's husband's ""sincere hope"" to be able to spend Chinese New Year with her, said Mr Lun.
Koh was warded both at the Institute of Mental Health and now SGH. Her lawyer said it is presently unclear what the reasons for her hospitalisation are.
However, he said it was ""unlikely to be COVID-19"", to his knowledge.
Koh is set to return to court on Feb 4. The two others linked to her case, Quah and his assistant Thomas Chua Cheng Soon, are similarly remanded and facing upgraded charges. INITIAL: ll(gs)",Channel NewsAsia,30-01-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999971641183366}",en,0.9999971641183366
128,"Healing the Divide founder Iris Koh hospitalised at SGH after being warded in IMH, gets charge upgraded
Today (Singapore) - Online
January 28, 2022 Friday","SINGAPORE - Iris Koh, the founder of controversial anti-vaccine group Healing the Divide, had her charge of cheating upgraded on Friday (Jan 28) to a more serious one. She was earlier accused of cheating the Ministry of Health (MOH) over allegedly fake vaccination records. Koh, 46, was first charged last Sunday and has been on remand since. Her new charge states that she was allegedly a party to a criminal conspiracy with a doctor, Jipson Quah, to defraud MOH between July last year and January this year, by agreeing to dishonestly make false representations to MOH that people were vaccinated with Sinopharm vaccine when they were not. 
When contacted by TODAY, Koh's lawyer, Mr Clarence Lun from Fervent Chambers, confirmed that she is now hospitalised in Singapore General Hospital, but said that he did not know why. ""We understand she was previously warded at IMH (Institute of Mental Health),"" Mr Lun added without giving more details. When asked if he would apply for Koh to be released on bail, the lawyer said that bail was denied during Friday's hearing held over Zoom, which was not open to the public or media. He also said that the defence is filing an application to the High Court to seek bail so that she may spend the upcoming Chinese New Year period with her family. Quah and his assistant, Thomas Chua Cheng Soon, similarly had their cheating charges amended on Tuesday and Friday respectively to one of fraud by false representation. This carries a maximum jail term of 20 years, while those convicted of cheating can be jailed for up to three years. Quah is said to have conspired with Chua and a woman named Mehrajunnisha to lie to MOH that she received Sinopharm vaccine when she did not. The police previously said that Koh had allegedly referred clients, believed to be members of Healing the Divide, to Quah and had also suggested administering something else in lieu of the vaccine to patients. It is unclear if Mehrajunnisha was a member of the anti-vaccine group. Quah now does not face any charges of conspiring with Koh, but prosecutors had said that investigations were ongoing and that they were unsure if more alleged offences would be uncovered. He remains remanded until next Monday after a judge rejected his lawyer's request for him to be released on bail. Koh and Chua are set to return to court on Feb 4. OTHER ALLEGATIONS MOH earlier said that one of the clinics where Quah works - Wan Medical Clinic in Bedok - had allegedly partnered Koh to offer ""remote"" pre-event testing using antigen rapid tests for members of Healing the Divide. It was found to have allegedly allowed people to submit unsupervised rapid tests, but lied that the clinic had supervised the tests. The clinic is said to have allowed people to submit pre-recorded videos or photos, or both, purporting to show that they had performed the rapid test on themselves. The clinic then uploaded the negative test results for them, MOH said. Quah was also found to have purportedly submitted a false positive antigen rapid test result to the Patient Risk Profile Portal, so that an unvaccinated patient could obtain a recovered status and be exempted from vaccine-related infection controls and regulations. MOH did not state who this patient was. The Patient Risk Profile Portal by MOH allows doctors to access patients' electronic records related to Covid-19. Separately, Koh and her husband - Mr Raymond Ng, 48 - have been under investigation for allegedly instigating more than 2,000 members of Healing the Divide's Telegram chat group to call andoverwhelm public phone linesthat help the public with Covid-19 matters.

131,"Singapore hospitals coping well, prepared for any surge in cases; Most resume full services, with staff allowed to take leave and no disruptions to operations
The Straits Times (Singapore)
January 29, 2022 Saturday","Hospitals here are coping well in spite of the Omicron wave infecting thousands of people daily. Most have resumed business as usual, with all wards open and staff encouraged to take leave.
 This is largely because the illness caused by this Covid-19 variant is generally mild, with 99.7 per cent of people having little or even no symptoms.
 Ministry of Health (MOH) data shows that while more than 600 people with Covid-19 are in hospital, only 10 are in the intensive care unit and 46 require oxygen.
 A National University Health System (NUHS) spokesman said: ""The majority of Covid-19 cases are currently managed in the community, and we will maintain a good bed occupancy rate by referring stable patients to home recovery.""
 Professor Fong Kok Yong, SingHealth's deputy group chief executive officer, said there are no disruptions to operations at its hospitals - Singapore General Hospital, Changi General Hospital (CGH), KK Women's and Children's Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital - even though emergency departments are seeing a gradual increase in respiratory illness and suspected Covid-19 cases.
 CGH has the busiest emergency department in Singapore, with 2,543 patients in the week ended Jan 22, slightly higher than the previous week's 2,497 patients seeking emergency care.
 Nevertheless, Prof Fong said, staff are still allowed to take leave, including overseas leave. This is rostered to ensure adequate staffing at the hospitals.
 At the National Healthcare Group, all services have resumed at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and bed occupancy is similar to that in pre-Covid-19 days.
 But the smaller Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) is running at nearly full capacity. It is the hospital with the second-highest emergency department attendance, with 2,249 patients seeking emergency care last week.
 The KTPH spokesman said: ""The current wave has not had a major impact on our staffing. None of our services or wards has had to close due to manpower constraints.""
 But because its wards are near capacity, the hospital continues to defer patients with non-urgent elective procedures, and has increased teleconsultations.
 All three public health clusters said staff are encouraged to take leave to rest, recharge and spend time with their families, although some have asked employees on leave to remain contactable in case of a sudden surge.
 The exception is KTPH, which said it has requested staff who have yet to apply for leave to defer it if possible until after the Omicron wave subsides.
 To prevent Covid-19 from spreading among staff, of whom 99.9 per cent are vaccinated, SingHealth has split-team arrangements with small teams to mitigate any potential viral spread.
 The NUHS spokesman said that support is given to staff ""through provision of meals, refreshments or care packs, and alternative short-term accommodation for those who prefer not to go home to minimise risk exposure to their kin"".
 Its staff now do antigen rapid tests at least twice a week ""to detect infection early and prevent transmission within the hospitals"". The spokesman added that inpatients are tested regularly for Covid-19, and in selected wards, they are tested three times weekly.
 All the hospitals say they are prepared for any potential surge in patients.
 The NUHS spokesman said: ""We have set aside existing beds that can potentially be converted to isolation beds for Covid-19 cases, as well as more holding facilities for suspect cases pending their results.
 ""There are also dedicated facilities and manpower to support the care of Covid-19 patients.""
 The spokesman said its senior management is aware of the importance of good communication, so they ""continually engage staff to provide clarity and direction for the changing situations"".
 They also ""ensure adequate support by making changes and adapting workflows with flexi-bility in manpower deployment to reduce staff burnout while meeting operational and safety requirements"".",The Straits Times (Singapore),28-01-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999976877207608}",en,0.9999976877207608
132,"3 fires in a single night; man arrested over Telok Blangah blaze
The Straits Times (Singapore)
January 30, 2022 Sunday","A 73-year-old man has been arrested in relation to a fire that broke out in a unit on the 10th storey of Block 39 Telok Blangah Rise early yesterday.
 It is understood that the man, arrested for mischief by fire, lives in the unit. At least two people were injured as a result of the blaze.
 This was the third blaze that firefighters had to battle in one night, following separate incidents hours earlier in Bedok and Tampines.
 The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a Facebook post yesterday that officers performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a woman who was found unconscious in the unit directly above the fire.
 Firefighters had conducted a forced entry into her home during an evacuation of residents from neighbouring units while firefighting operations were being carried out. She was taken to Singapore General Hospital, together with another person who had smoke inhalation injuries, said SCDF.
 The force was alerted to the fire at about 4.40am.
 ""Upon SCDF's arrival, the fire was raging and had totally engulfed a unit on the 10th floor,"" it said. ""Firefighters donned breathing apparatus sets and proceeded cautiously into the smoke-logged unit. The fire, which involved contents of the entire unit, was extinguished with two water jets.""
 About 280 people were evacuated as a precaution, said SCDF.
 Yesterday's blaze in Telok Blangah happened after fires broke out in two locations in eastern Singapore late on Friday.
 At about 10.30pm on Friday, the SCDF was alerted to a raging fire at a two-storey flat at Block 941 Tampines Avenue 5.
 SCDF officers had to break down a bedroom door in the 10th-storey unit to rescue an unconscious man trapped inside. The man was taken to Changi General Hospital.
 At midnight, a fire at a coffee shop at Block 204 Bedok North Street 1 prompted firefighters to evacuate 55 people living in flats above the eatery.
 The fire had engulfed the ground-floor premises, and had also spread to the kitchen exhaust duct at the side of the building.
 Firefighters deployed water jets around the premises to contain the fire. There were no reported injuries in the Bedok fire.
 The causes of the three fires are currently being investigated.
 Fires of electrical origins such as faulty wiring are the leading cause of all blazes here, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of all blazes in 2020, SCDF said in its latest full-year fire incidents statistics.
 The next most common cause are fires involving cooking activities, such as overheating of food.
 SCDF has cautioned against overloading electrical outlets with appliances, and to ensure that appliances are switched off when not in use. Appliances should be checked for frayed wires and cracked cords, and should be repaired or replaced if these are observed.
    RAGING FIRE  Upon SCDF's arrival, the fire was raging and had totally engulfed a unit on the 10th floor. Firefighters donned breathing apparatus sets and proceeded cautiously into the smoke-logged unit. The fire, which involved contents of the entire unit, was extinguished with two water jets.

133,"Restart, rewrite, re-check; The In This Together: Singapore's Covid-19 Story project was delayed thrice as journalists working on the best-selling book grappled with the pandemic's constant plot twists and turns
The Straits Times (Singapore)
January 30, 2022 Sunday","How do you write a book about Singapore's Covid-19 journey when the story, so to speak, is still unfolding'
 Journalists from The Straits Times grappled with this challenge while working on In This Together: Singapore's Covid-19 Story, a 352-page book chronicling the first two years of the pandemic.
 The project began in August 2020, with publication originally scheduled for the middle of last year.
 But twists and turns in the pandemic, such as the arrival of the Delta variant, meant interviews had to be redone and chapters rewritten.
 After being delayed three times, the book has hit the shelves and made its debut at No. 1 on The Sunday Times bestsellers list for non-fiction.
 It is published by Straits Times Press and edited by executive editor Sumiko Tan.
 It aims to pay tribute to front-liners - such as healthcare workers, public servants and those in essential services - and document a period in Singapore's history for future generations, Ms Tan says.
 The project involved contributions from people across the newsroom - not just the writers, who interviewed more than 300 people, but also copy editors, sub-editors, transcribers, graphic artists, book designers, proof checkers, photographers and more.
 Ms Tan adds: ""Is it corny to say just how the newsroom was also in this together'""
 The Sunday Times speaks to 15 people who helped bring the book to life.
  Book editor  Ms Sumiko Tan, 58Executive editor BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 That fact is stranger than fiction. Never did I imagine I would live in an era of a global pandemic and witness the sort of surreal scenes we saw.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 The biggest challenge was a technical one - whether we do a picture-or text-heavy book. For photos to look good, the book has to be in a large format. But if it is too big, heavy and wide, it won't be easy to read.
 We discussed this at length, took out our rulers and did many mock-ups to test the weight of different types of paper.
 We came up with a configuration that, we hope, has allowed us to tell the Covid-19 story in both words and beautiful photos.
  Writer  Mr Timothy Goh, 28Health correspondent BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 While Singapore's response to Covid-19 has appeared very calm and smooth, it was only through the various interviews that I realised the huge, huge amount of effort that went on quietly behind the scenes to ensure we could get through the crisis, and how close we came at certain points to ending up with a much worse outcome.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 When we started working on the book, there was an unspoken feeling that Covid-19 had been beaten.
 When the number of cases started rising again last year, we had to redo the interviews, re-angle stories and re-check all our information multiple times - and each time when we thought we could publish the book, cases would rise again and the cycle would repeat itself. It was a very, very long and tedious process.
  Copy editor  Ms Sharon Loh, 55Copy editor BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 Singapore knew very early that it had to scrap for everything it needed - from masks to hand sanitisers to vaccines. Unsung procurement agents went directly to sources to buy what we needed.
 Then there was the vaccine expert panel that must have had ice in their veins as they trawled through huge amounts of data on vaccine candidates. They did this while trials were ongoing, so they could place their bets on what they thought was most promising. At the risk of getting it wrong - though it turned out to be right - Singapore wanted to get in the queue early for a vaccine and not be caught flat-footed.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 How to tell a story that many Singaporeans already knew so much about, and were probably heartily sick of.
 In addition to the exclusive interviews the authors had, we wanted to convey, as viscerally as we could, the human experience behind the bald facts. The other thing was how to write it so that it wasn't self-congratulatory, but a faithful account of events.
  Book designer  Ms Sally Lam, 53Senior executive designer BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 Understanding the impact of the virus.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 The start-stop changes during the project due to the uncertainty of the Covid-19 situation, as these disturbed the team's momentum while designing the book.
  Writer  Mr Lim Yan Liang, 35Assistant political editor BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 The sheer scale of the efforts - public, private, community - that were undertaken to contend with the pandemic and deal with its effects.
 Hearing directly from key decision-makers such as Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean and Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen really brought home to me how much was unknown in the early days, and how policymakers had to draw from everything in their arsenal - be it past experience, global practices or literally from the reserves - and still had to be able to make adjustments on the fly.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 The constantly evolving virus and the new challenges it kept throwing up meant we were essentially writing two books.
 The first dealt with the first year of the pandemic up to the point where we were starting to roll out vaccines en masse. While none of the ministers we spoke to in late 2020 or early last year expected the pandemic to come to a quick end, some were quietly confident that we had turned a major corner in the fight. Of course, that just showed the capacity for Covid-19 to constantly surprise us.
  Sub-editor  Ms Joanna Lim, 47Senior executive sub-editor BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 Covid-19 has profoundly changed the lives of people, striking even when one least expects it to. Hearing the stories while working on this book has led me to re-evaluate what I want to do with my time.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 As the project stretched over more than a year and the Covid-19 situation was changing rapidly, the challenge was ensuring that the information from different writers was kept updated.
  Book designer  Mr Lock Hong Liang, 45Creative director of Straits Times Press BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 Magic happens when everyone in a team shares the same goal of seeing a meaningful project through to its completion against all odds.
 It's an indescribable sentiment when you see the book honour the lives of real people whose personal stories, losses, triumphs and sacrifices we have committed ourselves to telling and preserving.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 Having to work intensely together yet not often in the same physical space, where we could easily brisk-walk to one another's work stations, look at master files on the same screen and make changes to the pages directly.
  Writer  Ms Karamjit Kaur, 51News editor BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 That there are no easy answers to how to deal with Covid-19, with so many factors at play.
 Which is more important? Lives or livelihoods? From our chats with the multi-ministry task force co-chairs, it is clear this is something they grapple with every day.
 Even when decisions are made, it is not always possible to say with 100 per cent certainty if it was the right call. That is part of the challenge in dealing with a virus that continues to mutate and develop.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 Writing amid an ever-changing landscape is tough. You don't know if what you say today will still be relevant the week or month after.
 This meant that we had to go back to the multi-ministry task force co-chairs and other people we approached for the book more than once to update comments and quotes. All complied willingly and we are thankful for that.
  Sub-editor  Ms Lee Hui Chieh, 42Publishing editor of Straits Times Press BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 The book brought home the fact that so many people have been striving so hard, at significant sacrifice and risk, to keep Singapore safe and going strong despite the pandemic. I feel grateful for all these efforts and fortunate to be living in Singapore.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 Having to keep up with the rapid developments in the pandemic and the countermeasures was challenging.
  Writer  Ms Chang Ai-Lien, 51Associate news editor BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 What stood out is how so many people here rose to this unprecedented challenge - with nerves of steel and hearts of gold.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 The mercurial nature of the virus and its longevity meant that the book had to evolve along with it. Some of the people we interviewed left their jobs and, sadly, one died before she was able to see it.
  Infographics editor  Mr Lee Hup Kheng, 58Art editor BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 To have played a part in presenting stories about the greatest war of mankind, against one common enemy, and the drama that unfolded within each passing chapter in Singapore.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 For the design team, the biggest challenge was to work on a book that carries a bag of emotions, from triumphs to tragedies, using carefully chosen visual tools such as design, graphics and illustrations.
  Photo editor  Ms Stephanie Yeow, 51Picture editor BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 It is really hard work putting a book of this magnitude together. But I also realised how mammoth the task was and still is for a government to manage this pandemic well.
 It is not easy to control a virus like this and this book tells exactly what went on behind the scenes, which members of the public would never know... unless they read this book.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 We have amassed a huge collection of Covid-19-related images over the past two years as our photographers are shooting what we call ""Covid generics"" every day. These are photos of anything relating to Covid-19, be it safe management stickers, queues, checking in and out of establishments - you name it, we have probably shot it.
 My task was to find the gems amid the jewellery and immortalise them in this all-important book.
  Copy editor  Mr Rahul Pathak, 60Associate editor BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 Normal rules have not applied during the pandemic. Meticulous planning and even robust execution have not meant you are safe, though being careless has certainly got you in trouble.
 It struck me as I went through the stories that with our knowledge always lagging behind the evolving virus, there was a large element of luck that decided who got hit and who escaped. It was very humbling.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 We were trying to capture a story that was still unfolding and kept taking unexpected twists. That's why several chapters had to be revised more than once because they got overtaken by fresh developments.
  Photographer  Mr Lim Yaohui, 39Executive photojournalist BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 The virus is out there and we do not know who may be infected with it. I have to be careful and observe good personal hygiene when I am out shooting my assignments.
 If I feel unwell, I do an antigen rapid test straight away and see a doctor if necessary. If everyone acts responsibly, we will be able to keep the number of Covid-19 cases down and reduce the load on our healthcare workers.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 For the photographs I took inside Singapore General Hospital's isolation wards with Covid-19 patients and the Emergency Department, I had to be careful to keep a distance so that I would not get in the doctors' and nurses' way.
 I also had to shoot in a way that no one could identify the patient.
  Writer  Mr Rohit Brijnath, 59Assistant sports editor BIGGEST TAKEAWAY 
 Journalists, it's been said, produce the first draft of history and, really, this is what the book is. A hundred years from now when a young person wants to understand the impact of Covid-19 on Singapore, it is this book, hopefully, which he or she will reach for.
BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
 Remembering you are writing a story, or editing one, for a book and not the newspaper. And so you must write it in a way which, you hope, won't feel dated or dull even if you read it years later.
 You're also trying to find a balance, ensuring that the small human details don't get lost while charting the enormity of the challenge. And I think Sumiko, editor of the book, has managed to deftly accomplish that.

Today (Singapore) - Online
January 31, 2022 Monday","SINGAPORE - A general practitioner and his assistant, who allegedly submitted a false Covid-19 vaccination record for an unvaccinated woman in a case linked to an anti-vaccine group, were granted bail on Monday (Jan 31). The 33-year-old doctor, Jipson Quah, was earlier denied bail after the prosecution asked that he be remanded for another week for further investigations. This was given the urgency of making sure that unvaccinated people were not using their false vaccination status to enter places or take part in activities that need such checks. Quah is accused of making a false representationon Jan 14 to the Ministry of Health (MOH). He had recorded that the woman - identified in court documents as Mehrajunnisha- was given a Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine dose when she was not. 
This was allegedly so that she could get a certificate of vaccination. Quah and his assistant Thomas Chua Cheng Soon, 40, each face one charge of engaging in a conspiracy to dishonestly make a false representation to MOH. Quah was offered S$20,000 bail andChua was granted S$15,000 bail. The doctor and his assistant appeared in court on Monday via a video link from their place of remand. Quah was represented by a new lawyer, Mr Anand Nalachandran of law firm Forte Law, who took over the case from a team of lawyersfrom legal practice Withers KhattarWong.District Judge Terence Tay granted Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Samuel Yap's request to order Quah and Chua not to communicate with each other, Mehrajunnisha or any of the prosecution's witnesses while out on bail. An exception was made to allow Quah to contact staff members at his clinics for work reasons.MOH had suspended four clinics that he owns or manages. They are Wan Medical Clinic in Bedok North, Mayfair Medical Clinic in Woodlands, Mayfair Medical Clinic (Yishun Chong Pang), and Ong Clinic and Surgery (Yishun). Quah and Chua were also ordered not to contact Iris Koh, the founder of anti-vaccine group Healing the Divide. Koh was charged last week with conspiring with Quah between July last year and January this year to defraud MOH by agreeing to dishonestly make false representations that people were vaccinated with Sinopharm when they were not.Koh allegedly referred clients, believed to be members of Healing the Divide, to Quah and was also said to have suggested administering something else in lieu of the vaccine to patients. She remains on remand at the Singapore General Hospital after the High Court on Monday dismissed her application for bail. DPP Samuel Yap told the court on Monday that investigations were still under way, and asked for a six-week adjournment for the cases involving Quah and Chua.They will be heard again in court on March 14. For dishonestly making a false representation under Section 424A of the Penal Code, the two men could be jailed for up to 20 years or fined, or punished with both.",Today (Singapore) - Online,31-01-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999959232411944}",en,0.9999959232411944
135,"Judge denies bail for Healing the Divide founder Iris Koh, after &#039;appalling belligerence&#039; including tearing up charge sheet
Today (Singapore) - Online
January 31, 2022 Monday","SINGAPORE - Iris Koh, the founder of anti-vaccine group Healing the Divide, was again denied bail on Monday (Jan 31) after her lawyer took to the High Court in a bid for her to be released before the Chinese New Year festivities. During a hearing on her application for bail, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Jiang Ke-Yue told the court that investigations have ""disclosed more offences"" and that her criminal conspiracy involved at least 20 patients. Koh, 46, has been on remand for about a week. She filed the application after being denied bail in the State Courts last Friday, when her cheating charge was upgraded to one of being a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. She is accused of working with general practitioner Jipson Quah to defraud the Ministry of Health (MOH) between July last year and January this year, by agreeing to dishonestly make false representations to MOH that people were vaccinated with Sinopharm vaccine when they were not. 
On Monday, Justice Vincent Hoong ruled that her application for bail or a temporary release from remand was ""wholly devoid of merit"", adding that her efforts to ""frustrate and impede investigations"" have significantly contributed to the further need for remand. This included tearing up a charge sheet and police statement. The hearing was held over video-conferencing platform Zoom. Koh appeared from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) where she has been warded. The prosecution opposed her application, saying that she needed to be further remanded for investigations and that she has shown a ""pattern of behaviour that shows her determination"" not to cooperate with the police. Koh's co-accused, Quah and his assistant Thomas Chua Cheng Soon, were offered bail on Monday morning in the State Courts. WHAT HAPPENED DURING REMAND PERIOD Koh's lawyer Clarence Lun said that Koh was admitted for observation at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for suspected psychosis after she was arrested on Jan 21. DPP Jiang said that she had claimed to be suffering from anxiety and panic attacks when she was arrested. However, she refused to be referred to IMH when the attending doctor recommended it. The next day, she was able to give a police statement, read it over and sign it. However, the following day on Jan 23 when she was charged, she asked to be taken to IMH, where she was assessed to be mentally fit for investigations and discharged. On the fourth day of her remand period, she asked to file a police report against an investigation officer. DPP Jiang did not reveal why but said that the authorities acceded to her request and that the reporting process took two hours ""because she had a lot of things to say"". On the fifth day, she complained of discomfort but refused to be taken to IMH again. After she was given dinner and allowed to rest, the investigation officer took another statement from her. ""This time, she refused to read the statement... and tore it up,"" DPP Jiang told the court. The next day - Jan 26 - Koh complained of discomfort and anxiety at about 5.30am. She was assessed to have a fast heartbeat and was taken to SGH in an ambulance, where she was warded for observation for hyperthyroidism, a pre-existing condition for her. This happens when someone's thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than the body needs, resulting in symptoms such as a rapid or irregular heartbeat. She then refused to be discharged after claiming that her heart was still beating ""very fast"". The upgraded charge was served to her in SGH with an appropriate adult present, but her ""behaviour changed"" and she shouted a vulgarity at the investigation officer, DPP Jiang said. ""The appropriate adult was so afraid, she did not want to sign on the charge either,"" the prosecutor added. The Appropriate Adult Scheme provides assistance to persons with intellectual or mental disability who have to give a statement to the police during investigation. The appropriate adult helps withcommunication during the police interview so that there is no misunderstanding of the questions asked or the replies given, to ensure a reliable statement is recorded. DPP Jiang said that on Jan 28, Koh complained of a headache but declined to take medication. She then tore up a copy of the amended charge and ""created a scene"" at SGH, which meant that arrangements had to be made to restrain her and take her to a private room for her to be formally charged with the more serious offence. During the hearing, she could follow proceedings with Mr Lun, and doctors confirmed that her pre-existing condition would not affect her. She was set to be discharged from the hospital at noon on Monday, with another biopsy required for some thyroid nodules in two to three weeks' time. 'APPALLING ACCOUNT OF BELLIGERENCE' Mr Lun acknowledged that Koh's current offence is a non-bailable one but sought her release on bail on the basis that she was medically unfit for investigations. He also questioned how likely it was for evidence to be obtained during the Chinese New Year period. The defence counsel also argued that the prosecutors had not explained why and how Koh's release would affect public interests. In response, DPP Jiang said that Koh's own conduct had delayed investigations so far. MOH had earlier said that she allegedly partnered one of Quah's clinics to offer unsupervised ""remote"" pre-event testing using antigen rapid tests for members of Healing the Divide. The police also said that Koh had allegedly referred clients, believed to be members of Healing the Divide, to Quah for fake Covid-19 vaccination records. She also purportedly suggested administering something else in lieu of the vaccine to patients. DPP Jiang argued that there is significant public concern in determining the exact number of patients involved and that the authorities need her cooperation. He also said that Koh is medically fit for investigations. ""The evidence shows she's not cooperating and she has some part to play in the current delay. As we speak, the other two co-accused who have been cooperating - arrangements are currently being made for their release,"" DPP Jiang said, referring to Quah and Chua. In dismissing Koh's bail application, Justice Hoong agreed with the prosecution that the complexity and urgency of investigations meant that the district judge was right to remand Koh further. ""It was precisely due to (her) efforts to frustrate and impede investigations, which have significantly contributed to the need for this further period of remand,"" the judge said, adding that an investigation officer's affidavit contained an ""appalling account of belligerence, obstructive behaviour and lack of cooperation"" on Koh's part. The judge also said that her promise to cooperate ""rings hollow"", given her behaviour and ""blatant disregard for the investigative and court processes"" by tearing up the charge sheet and police statement. Koh and her group have been embroiled in various controversies in recent months, such as allegedly telling parents to overwhelm medical staff members at paediatric vaccination centres with questions. She and her husband Raymond Ng, who was in court on Monday, have been probed for instigating group members to call andoverwhelm public phone linesthat help the public with Covid-19 matters.",Today (Singapore) - Online,31-01-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999987181017576}",en,0.9999987181017576
136,"Court dismisses application for Healing the Divide's Iris Koh to celebrate Chinese New Year with family
Channel NewsAsia
January 31, 2022 Monday 1:33 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: The High Court has denied a request for Iris Koh, the founder of Healing the Divide group that has a known stance against COVID-19 vaccination, to spend Chinese New Year with her family.
On Monday (Jan 31), the court dismissed an application from her lawyer, Mr Clarence Lun of Fervent Chambers, to reverse Koh's no-bail condition set by the State Courts last Friday. The application also sought to grant the 46-year-old ""temporary release"" from remand.
It is Koh's husband's ""sincere hope"" to be able to spend Chinese New Year with her, Mr Lun told CNA.
In his judgment, High Court judge Justice Vincent Hoong said there was ""no legal basis"" to grant a temporary release from remand. Moreover, the High Court's revisionary powers to set aside the district judge's orders for no bail should be ""sparingly exercised"".
Koh is currently warded at Singapore General Hospital, and will be remanded again once she is discharged. FAMILY TIME FOR 'EMOTIONAL STRENGTH'
Mr Lun argued that given his client's health condition, Koh should be allowed to spend time with her loved ones to ""gain emotional strength"".
""Against the fact that we're approaching Chinese New Year and where any accused who is in remand will probably require some family support, and what (better time) other than during this festive season to spend time with family to gain that emotional strength and then to carry on with the investigations?""
Having previously been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, Koh ""probably requires some rest and family support to better recover and further assist police in their investigations"", said Mr Lun.
""We're not saying that my client is not suitable for investigations. But what are the conditions that are best imposed and that best fit (her) interest and public interest? ... For someone who has been suffering (from) suspected psychosis and hypothyroidism, what is the mental and emotional state for them to assist the police?""
Mr Lun added that evidence is ""unlikely to be obtained"" during the Chinese New Year period, and said the prosecution had not ""set out to explain how evidence is likely to be obtained during this period of remand, taking into account (Koh's) health conditions"".
He also said the prosecution hasn't explained why and how Koh's release would affect public interest, as there is ""no evidence that my client will tamper with evidence if she's released on bail"".
The lawyer then proposed to the court that Koh could report to the police from Friday (Feb 4) onwards during the working hours of 9am to 6pm, excluding weekends.
He suggested that as a further condition, the court could impose non-communication between Koh and the relevant parties who have been identified in investigations to allay any doubts on tampering of evidence.
Mr Lun also said that Koh's passport had been impounded, so she isn't a flight risk.
'PATTERN' OF UNCOOPERATIVE BEHAVIOUR
In response, the prosecution argued there is ""no merit"" for the two assertions by the defence: First, that Koh was medically unfit to cooperate with investigations, and second, that she would cooperate with investigations.
""Thus far, she has not been cooperative with investigations and contributed to the delay,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke-Yue.
Mr Jiang highlighted that Koh had been assessed by several doctors to be medically and ""mentally"" fit for investigations. He added that the latest email updates from the investigating officer to Koh's husband stated that while Koh requires a medical procedure for her hypothyroidism, this would be done in two to three weeks' time when her thyroid hormone level has stabilised.
Details of Koh's ""pattern of behaviour that shows her determination not to cooperate"" from the day of her arrest were also presented in court by Mr Jiang.
For instance, she complained of anxiety and panic attacks when she was arrested on Jan 21, but refused to be referred to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). Yet she was able to understand the statement read out to her and sign the document with ""no issue"".
When the charge for her remand was made on Jan 23, Koh requested to be referred to IMH for anxiety.
The following day, she requested to lodge a police report against the investigating officer. The request was acceded to by the police, and the reporting process took two hours because ""she had a lot of things to say"", said Mr Jiang.
The day after that, despite complaining of discomfort and being assessed by a doctor who recommended that she be referred to IMH again, she refused. After dinner that day, the investigating officer printed out her written statement for her to read and sign as she did previously - but this time, she tore up the statement. Koh, who was first charged with one count of conspiring with doctor Jipson Quah to cheat the Ministry of Health (MOH) into believing that people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine, received a more serious charge of criminal conspiracy to give a false representation to MOH on Friday.
She is now accused of being party to a criminal conspiracy with Quah between July 2021 and January 2022. This new charge is punishable by up to 20 years' jail, a fine, or both.
When Koh's amended charge was handed to her in hospital on Friday in the presence of ""an appropriate adult"", she ""scolded vulgarities"", the court heard from Mr Jiang.
The accompanying person was ""so afraid"" by Koh's outburst that they didn't sign the memo either, said Mr Jiang.
Mr Jiang also told the court that the police have been ""accommodating, providing medical attention where necessary"".
He added that it is ""speculative"" on the defence lawyer's part that no headway will be made on investigations during the Chinese New Year period.
""If Ms Koh cooperates over the next few days, we should be able to make some headway ... We should be on track for her release on Feb 4.""
Mr Jiang added that the other two co-accused, doctor Jipson Quah and his assistant Thomas Chua, have been cooperating with investigations and arrangements have been made for their release.
As Mr Jiang was reading out his submissions, Koh could be seen over Zoom raising her hand, shaking her head, and mouthing the word ""no"", but the judge ignored her.
'APPALLING ACCOUNT OF BELLIGERENCE'
In his judgment, Justice Hoong said he held the view that there was ""no error made"" by the district judge who ordered Koh's remand.
""Based on the prosecution's submissions concerning the complexity, necessity and urgency of the application, the district judge was wholly entitled to exercise her discretion to grant the said order for remand. I am also of the view that no grave and serious injustice has been occasioned to the applicant by the judge's order,"" he said.
He also agreed with the prosecution that it was precisely Koh's efforts to ""frustrate and impede the investigations"" that contributed to the need for this further period of remand.
These efforts were captured by the investigating officer's ""appalling account"" of Koh's ""belligerence, obstructive behaviour and lack of cooperation"" since her remand began on Jan 23.
He further agreed with the prosecution that Koh's promise to cooperate with investigations ""rings hollow"", considering her ""consistent attempts to impede investigations"".
""(She) has also displayed a blatant disrespect for the investigative and court processes by tearing up her charge and statement and disrupting court proceedings. The consequent delays to investigations are no doubt caused by her active and deliberate attempts to frustrate those very investigations,"" said Justice Hoong.
""I accordingly place no weight on her bare promise of cooperation.""
Justice Hoong also said that even though the situation remains ""fluid"", Koh had been assessed to be fit for discharge on Monday. She was also assessed to be ""medically fit to be interviewed and thus fit for investigations"".
He acknowledged that she was, however, scheduled for a biopsy in two to three weeks' time.
In response, the defence said Koh's husband requested to visit her in the hospital during her period of remand, but the prosecution replied that ""there is no basis for such visitation rights"".
The judge agreed with the prosecution, and denied Koh these visitation rights. INITIAL: gy(ta)",Channel NewsAsia,3-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999959011048399}",en,0.9999959011048399
137,"Jab fraud: Anti-vaccination group founder denied bail; Prosecution reveals at least 20 patients were involved in alleged conspiracy
The Straits Times (Singapore)
February 1, 2022 Tuesday","Iris Koh, founder of anti-vaccine group Healing the Divide, was denied bail in the High Court yesterday, as the prosecution revealed that at least 20 patients were involved in an alleged vaccination fraud conspiracy that she has been charged with.
 Koh, 46, was charged last Friday with conspiring with general practitioner Jipson Quah to make false representations to the Ministry of Health that unvaccinated people were given the Sinopharm vaccine, when they were not.
 Yesterday, prosecutors, in arguing against Koh's bid to be granted bail, said at least 20 patients were involved in the alleged conspiracy, and that ongoing investigations have revealed offences relating to remote pre-event testing and false vaccine exemption letters.
 The prosecution said Koh has been uncooperative since her arrest on Jan 21, and this has delayed police investigations.
 Koh tore up a police statement on her fifth day in remand, and tore up the charge that was read to her last Friday, in what the judge said was ""blatant disrespect for the investigative and court processes"".
 She also repeatedly complained of anxiety and panic attacks, but refused medical attention.
 Justice Vincent Hoong agreed with the prosecutors that Koh's lack of cooperation with police investigators contributed to the need to remand her for investigations.
 ""I agree with the prosecution that it is precisely due to the applicant's efforts to frustrate and impede the investigations which have significantly contributed to the need for this further period of remand,"" he said.
 He noted that her ""belligerence, obstructive behaviour and lack of cooperation with investigations"" during the initial period of remand, which started on Jan 23, was ""appalling"".
 He said Koh's application for bail was ""wholly devoid of merit"".
 The judge noted that she has been charged with a non-bailable offence, and the onus was on her to provide evidence to satisfy the court that bail should be granted.
 Koh's lawyer, Mr Clarence Lun, had raised Koh's medical condition - hyperthyroidism - as a factor to support her application.
      'Determined not to cooperate' Giving an account of Iris Koh's behaviour during remand, Deputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke-yue said in court yesterday: ""She has demonstrated a pattern of behaviour that shows her determination not to cooperate.""
 Â· On Day 1, Koh complained of anxiety and panic attacks but refused to be admitted to the Institute of Mental Health.
 Â· On Day 4, she spent two hours making a police report against the investigation officer.
 Â· On Day 5, she refused medical attention despite complaining of discomfort, and also tore up the statement taken from her.
 Â· On Day 6, she was warded for observation at the Singapore General Hospital.
 Â· On Day 7, she refused to be discharged despite being assessed fit to do so. When the charge was read to her, she tore the charge sheet, shouted her refusal to accept it and hurled a vulgarity at the investigation officer.
    But Justice Hoong said this was an insufficient reason for bail to be granted. He noted that Koh had been assessed to be fit for discharge from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) yesterday, and is scheduled for a biopsy procedure in two to three weeks.
 ""The latest medical memo... also indicates that the applicant is medically fit to be interviewed and is thus fit for investigations,"" he said.
 Mr Lun said Koh's husband had requested to visit her in the hospital during her remand, but the prosecution replied that ""there is no basis for such visitation rights"".
 Agreeing with the prosecution, Justice Hoong denied Koh the visitation rights.
 During the hearing held via videoconference, Koh, who was muted, could be seen raising her hand and appeared to be speaking but was ignored by the judge, who noted that she has legal representation.
 Deputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke-yue told the court that the police have been accommodating to Koh and offered medical attention where necessary, but the evidence showed that she was not cooperating.
 The DPP said that when the charge was read to Koh at SGH last Friday, she shouted her refusal to accept it, hurled a vulgarity at the investigation officer and tore up the charge sheet.
 The DPP noted that the other two accused persons charged in relation to the conspiracy - Quah and his assistant Thomas Chua Cheng Soon, 40 - have been cooperative and been granted bail.

138,"Meet the Singaporean who turns your greasy disposable chopsticks into beautiful furniture
Channel NewsAsia
February 1, 2022 Tuesday 6:57 AM GMT","If you have eaten at a restaurant, cafe or hospital coffee shop recently, you may be surprised to know that your greasy disposable chopsticks may already be displayed at someone else's house today.
Perhaps it is part of the wall decor. Or perhaps it is a small table or shelf.
That is what ChopValue Singapore is about. Twice a week, two team members spend an entire day travelling to 100 restaurants and three hospitals around Singapore picking up our trash - hundreds of thousands of used chopsticks. They then upcycle these into gorgeous furniture.
Helming this new franchise in Singapore since April 2021 is Evelyn Hew. The 37-year-old entrepreneur imported this sustainable business all the way from Vancouver, Canada.
""We have always thought that Singapore lacked natural resources. Actually, we do have resources. It is our trash,"" she said. ""On a farm, you produce and harvest crops. In a city, where we have so many humans closely packed together, what you produce is waste. If you are creative, you can transform this waste into resources. That is what 'urban harvesting' is about,"" she added.
Hew and her team have since salvaged and upcycled 1.2 million pairs of chopsticks from people's dinner plates, saving them from the incinerator.
FROM SHOPPER TO ECO-ENTREPRENEUR
Hew was not always a sustainability champion. In her 20s, she was a voracious shopper with closets stacked with clothes, many unworn, with tags still intact. However, having her first child in 2014 prompted her to reconsider the impact of present-day consumption on future generations. A year later, in 2015, the serial entrepreneur founded SmartCity Solutions, offering Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions to public waste collectors to digitally transform the industry.
""That was when I realised how much waste we are creating,"" she recalled.
""As part of our (service), we deployed RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags on recycling bins and witnessed firsthand how badly contaminated they were. If dirty plastic bags or food waste were found in the recycling bin, the entire bin would be contaminated and disposed of,"" she said.
This prompted her to search for upcycling solutions that would address the waste and contamination problem. One day, she chanced upon ChopValue Canada on Facebook, and learnt about their model for collecting, sanitising and upcycling used chopsticks. Something clicked.
Chopsticks are a daily necessity in many Asian cultures, such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean. And in Singapore, because of our dabao (takeaway) culture, many use disposable chopsticks.
""We cut down bamboo, birch and pine to make them, fly them 3,000 to 5,000 km from China to Singapore, and just use them for 20 to 30 minutes. Don't you feel it's a huge waste?"" she asked.
TURNING TRASH TO FURNITURE
Truly, even new disposable chopsticks have never been considered beautiful or coveted by any stretch, much less soiled chopsticks discarded after a meal.
However, via a fine-tuned process that combines technology and craftsmanship, ChopValue transforms them into chic minimalist furniture and home decor, each distinct with its unique grain. Every piece tells a story of Singapore's food and dabao culture, as well as its own cool sustainability journey, interweaving the dining experience and memories of hundreds of diners. The best part? These waste products are upcycled with minimal water, zero toxins and less carbon emission.
After collection, the used chopsticks are sent to a micro-factory, coated in a toxin-free resin and baked to 200 degrees Celsius to disinfect them, instead of using water. Then, they are ultra-compressed into highly densified tiles for optimal strength and durability. A single coaster uses as many as 76 chopsticks. Prices range from S$158 for the wall decor set to S$1,288 for the home office desk. Though costlier than fast furniture, such as those made of plywood, they are comparably priced to well-made oak or teak furniture.
Of course, actual prices also do not reflect the cost to the environment. Upcycled chopstick-made tiles take mere days to harvest and process, as opposed to the 10 to 30 years it takes to grow trees from scratch for lumbering, and the eco-cost of deforestation.
CHALLENGES OF A SUSTAINABILITY ENTREPRISE
Hew had to overcome several obstacles to transform vision into reality. As part of outreach, she contacted innumerable restaurants and met many managers with her sustainability pitch, and all in the middle of the pandemic.
Several rejected the idea because they were concerned it would be time consuming. She was however, heartened by the number of buy-ins.
Among the first restaurants to join in the chopstick collection were Nara Japanese Restaurant, Yamato Japanese Restaurant and Tatsuya. The three participating hospitals include Singapore General Hospital, KK Women's and Children's Hospital and Sengkang General Hospital. Over the past four months, Hew managed to increase the chopsticks collected fivefold, from 100,000 pairs in September 2021 to 500,000 pairs in January 2022.
However, she would sometimes find other trash in the chopsticks recycle bins. So after collection, she and her team had to sift out sundry items such as used tissue paper.
Staffing was another problem. ""We don't have a lot of factories dealing with woodwork in Singapore, so there were a lot of things we had to learn from scratch from the Vancouver team,"" she said.
Unfortunately, COVID-19 got in the way of the knowledge transference. When she booked tickets for the Vancouver ChopValue team to visit Singapore in December last year, they were unexpectedly turned away at Vancouver International Airport. The team had to learn all aspects of production via video calls, including how to adapt the material for Singapore's weather and humidity.
A CULTURE OF URBAN HARVESTING
ChopValue Singapore currently has five products on their website, including wall decor items, shelves and tables.
Over the next few months, they will be expanding their range to 50 products, including smaller items such as handphone and iPad stands, and cheese boards. They also offer custom designs at a slight premium. Moving forward, Hew also hopes to expand the collection drive to coffeeshops, hawker centres, households and offices by enlisting the help of government agencies, SembWaste, town councils and community clubs.
Hew's children have been her greatest inspiration on this sustainability journey. The mother-of-three said she often joins her children on bottle recycling campaigns organised by their school and estate, washing the bottles and dropping them into dedicated bins. ""I remember a comment from my eldest child Vera. When we dropped off the recyclables, she commented: ""Why do I have to do this? Will you buy me a toy if I do?"" That is when I realised that it was an actual depiction of the recycling scene in Singapore - people are motivated to recycle when incentivised,"" she reflected.
Her goal: To motivate others to upcycle by transforming the humblest of waste materials - disposed chopstick stained with shoyu or char kway teow - into a beautifully designed home collection.
She hopes it will inspire other businesses to think about other materials from the waste stream that they can work with. ""That way, maybe future textbooks will teach that Singapore no longer lacks resources,"" she mused.

139,"Doctor suspended after taking photos, videos of men changing in swimming pools' toilets
Channel NewsAsia
February 4, 2022 Friday 4:44 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: A doctor has been suspended for nine months by a disciplinary tribunal after he was convicted of taking photos and videos of men changing in swimming pools' toilets.
Dr Aaron Gan Tau Ming, who was a senior resident at Singapore General Hospital at the time of the offences, pleaded guilty to 16 charges, said the grounds of the decision published by the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) on Monday (Jan 31).
He was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment and fined S$14,900.
The offences took place from early 2016 to mid-2017 mainly in the toilets of Tampines SAFRA swimming pool and Queenstown swimming pool. While he was there, he took photographs and videos of men in the shower area of the toilets.
The men were in various states of undress, and some were nude, according to the grounds. Dr Gan took the photos and videos by placing his mobile phone to his ear and pretending he was talking to someone when he was taking the photos and videos by pointing the camera at the victims.
A man alerted the security officer at Tampines SAFRA swimming pool and the police were called in.
The tribunal heard that the videos and photos were only viewed by the doctor and were not in the public domain.
Of the 16 charges, 10 related to taking photographs, while four involved photos and videos. The remaining two offences relate to making obscene videos.
The SMC's lawyer, Ms Shalini Mogan, asked for a 12-month suspension for the doctor, taking into consideration his ""timely guilt of plea"".
She said the case involved multiple similar offences over a long period of time and involved ""calculation and deliberation"".
Dr Gan's defence lawyers, Ms Audrey Sim and Ms Joie Tan, said that the offences reflected his ""moral failing"" and that it has not impacted his professional duties, adding that he remained a ""committed and outstanding doctor"".
They said that there was ""no evidence of the fact that the victims were emotionally harmed"", adding that there was no physical contact with the victims.
According to the grounds of decision, Dr Gan was facing ""immense feelings of social isolation"" and preferred to spend time alone. He was ""labouring under suppression"" - described as a maladaptive psychological defence mechanism - as detailed in medical reports, said his lawyers.
""Simply put, he sought a substitute channel to expressing his homosexual orientation so as to keep his sexual orientation a secret,"" according to the grounds.
A consultant in psychological medicine assessed his mental state in 2019 and in October 2021, Dr Gan's lawyers said, adding that these ""collectively refer to the respondent's voyeuristic behaviour as conduct related to his attempts to avoid homosexual intimacy"".
They asked for a suspension of four months.
In response, the tribunal said that the personal mitigating circumstances of Dr Gan - in particular, the ridicule by his schoolmates and working colleagues arising from their insinuations about his sexual orientation, ""certainly calls for understanding"".
But they added that it bore ""little relevance"" to the proceedings.
""Almost without exception, every human being struggles at different times and to varying degrees with personal circumstances,"" said the tribunal, according to their grounds.
""The call of a doctor requires that he overcomes his struggle without harming another. If he is not able to do so, to then have the courage to find help in addressing the challenge.
""There is indeed nothing to be ashamed of and everything to be gained from understanding one's sexual orientation and ensuring that it is expressed in a way that does not compromise the interests of others.""
Calling competence and trustworthiness the ""cornerstones of the practice of medicine"", they said he was ""tasked daily"" to respect the bodies of his patients.
These acts were done for the ""sole purpose of gratifying his needs"" and that he ""defiled the sanctity of the body he took an oath to protect, heal and restore"".
""It is almost impossible to gather evidence of the emotional stress endured by victims of these types of offences as it may not be evident in the short term and many may be embarrassed to speak about it,"" said the tribunal.
While acknowledging that Dr Gan is a ""young doctor"" who has a ""long way to go in medical practice"", they added that a signal must be clear that the behaviour that ""compromises the body and spirit of another"" will not be tolerated.
The tribunal also heard that he had resigned from service at Singapore General Hospital, and that he has ""already paid a price with respect to his career"".
""He is willing to take steps to address his challenges and did not hesitate to plead guilty. We acknowledge his remorse and applaud his resolve,"" said the tribunal.
Besides being suspended for nine months, he has to work with a psychiatrist of his choice with a view of ""addressing the behaviour detailed in the charges"" to prevent similar conduct when he resumes his duties.
Dr Gan was also ordered to pay the costs and expenses of the proceedings. INITIAL: mi(ac)",Channel NewsAsia,7-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999965535523466}",en,0.9999965535523466
140,"Children aged 5 to 11 have highest infection rate here; Health Minister says Omicron variant more likely to infect children than the Delta variant
The Straits Times (Singapore)
February 9, 2022 Wednesday","Children aged five to 11 currently have the highest rate of Covid-19 infection here, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said yesterday.
 Speaking at the Singapore Health Quality Service Awards 2022 held at the Singapore General Hospital Campus, Mr Ong, who was the guest of honour, said that while hospitals may not currently be stressed in the same way as during the Delta wave, there is a need to ensure there are sufficient paediatric beds.
 This is because the Omicron variant is more likely to infect children than the Delta variant, he added.
 The infection rate for children aged five to 11 is currently about 67 per 100,000 population, said Mr Ong.
 Those aged 12 to 19 have the next highest infection rate, at about 55 per 100,000.
 ""This is quite different as compared to during the Delta wave, which mostly infected older adults,"" the minister said.
 He added that the current infection rate among older age groups is lower, but did not give further details.
 ""With more children and young people getting infected, severe cases are inevitable and we need to ensure that there are sufficient beds for them,"" he said, adding that public and private hospitals are standing up more such beds, while Covid-19 treatment facilities are also converting more beds for children and their caregivers.
 One such facility is Connect@ Changi at Expo, where 660 beds are being prepared.
 Fortunately, said Mr Ong, the hospitalisation of children due to Covid-19 is often precautionary in nature, with short stays of about two to three days.
 ""Notwithstanding, it is important to get them vaccinated to protect them against the risk of severe illness should they get infected,"" he added.
 Mr Ong emphasised that vaccines and booster shots continue to make a significant difference to the clinical outcomes of infected individuals.
 He first noted that currently, 0.3 per cent of patients, whether young or old, who are infected with the Omicron variant need oxygen supplementation or care in the intensive care unit (ICU).
 Then, citing the example of seniors, Mr Ong said that while on average, 1.8 per cent of those aged 60 and up who are infected with Omicron required oxygen supplementation or ICU care, this varies depending on vaccination status.
 For seniors who have taken their booster, said Mr Ong, this figure drops to 1 per cent or less. This rises to around 4 per cent for those fully vaccinated with no booster.
 But for those who are not fully vaccinated, the rate of such severe illness is about 10 per cent.
 A senior above 60 who is not fully vaccinated is 10 times as likely to fall severely sick when infected with Omicron compared with a senior who has taken the booster shot, said Mr Ong.
 ""And that is why vaccination and boosters, especially among seniors, continue to be our key priority,"" he added.",The Straits Times (Singapore),8-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999977685372516}",en,0.9999977685372516
141,"Superstar awards for healthcare workers who went the extra mile; Eight receive top honours at Singapore Health Quality Service Awards
The Straits Times (Singapore)
February 9, 2022 Wednesday","While some Singaporeans would view an overseas trip during the Covid-19 pandemic as a chance for sightseeing and rest, Dr Linus Chua spent his only overseas trip since 2020 in flood-hit Timor Leste, helping to build up the country's healthcare system amid a surge in coronavirus cases.
 For his efforts and more, he was one of eight Superstar award recipients at this year's Singapore Health Quality Service Awards yesterday.
 The awards, which recognise outstanding healthcare professionals who have shown remarkable commitment in delivering quality care and excellent patient experience, were presented at a hybrid ceremony at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Campus.
 About 9,000 healthcare professionals and partners from 41 public and private healthcare institutions, community hospitals and agencies from the community care sector received awards at the ceremony.
 Dr Chua, who is an associate consultant in the Department of Medical Services at St Luke's Hospital, took two months of unpaid leave to go to Timor Leste in mid-April last year.
 While there, he trained local medical residents in family medicine and helped some prepare for their examinations, worked on research on chronic disease management, and gave health talks at schools and hostels - all while braving failing sewerage systems, electric shocks and getting bitten by a wild dog.
 While acknowledging that there was a lot of suffering and changes to lives in Singapore during the pandemic, Dr Chua said that ""overseas, the needs are immense as well"".
 He pointed out that the healthcare system in Timor Leste was under-resourced and had to deal with natural disasters and the pandemic at the same time.
 Back in Singapore, Dr Chua helped form a community response team to care for elderly patients, most of whom have dementia, at home - diagnosing them, providing medication, educating their families in caregiving skills, and linking them with community care resources.
 Another Superstar award recipient was Ms Tanuja Nair, principal child life therapist at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, who developed a programme to look after the psychosocial wellness of young Covid-19 patients.
 Ms Tanuja, who is also head of Child Life, Art and Music Therapy Programmes at the hospital, said young patients may process information differently from the way adults do, and feel overwhelmed or fail to understand why they need to isolate. Some may also be afraid of the process.
 So, she and her team produced videos, podcasts and engagement kits - containing storybooks and activities such as games - to help both patients and caregivers cope with their situation. More than 2,800 such kits were distributed from March 2020 to December last year.
 Among other things, Ms Tanuja was also part of a project group initiated by the Institute of Mental Health that produced a kit helping front-liners and caregivers support individuals with special needs through their Covid-19 experiences.
 A third winner, Clinical Associate Professor Veronique Tan, head and senior consultant at the department of breast surgery at SGH and the National Cancer Centre Singapore, co-created a programme with a senior nurse to train enrolled nurses as surgical assistants, in order to make up for manpower shortages due to the pandemic.
 Prof Tan trained and guided about 20 nurses to take on the role that is usually performed by junior surgeons or medical officers. To date, the nurses have assisted with more than 250 surgical operations.
 She also worked with the Health Promotion Board and Ministry of Education to improve breast health literacy in schools.
 ""I want to teach a whole generation of young girls... Hopefully there'll be a day where it's in the curriculum, and everybody knows about breast health and breast cancer,"" she said.
 Five teams that championed innovative and sustainable initiatives with impactful results and benefits to patients, staff and the public were given the Best Team award.
 One such team from the National Heart Centre Singapore helped heart operation patients to move around on their own two days sooner than usual, which in turn improved their recovery and allowed them to be discharged earlier.
 Such patients need to be hooked up to multiple chest drains, which are held by a stand.
 The team redesigned the metal stands for these holders to make them more stable, and added hooks to hang the chest drains and tubes neatly.
 Congratulating the award recipients, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who was guest of honour, said: ""Patients' trust in us is critical. And that is built up over a long time when we consistently give our best to serve them.""
 He added: ""With strong partnership and trust amongst us, I am confident we will emerge from this long-drawn pandemic battle victorious, and bring our healthcare system to even greater heights.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),8-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999969540745524}",en,0.9999969540745524
142,"Healthcare workers describe struggles as patients flood emergency rooms amid Omicron wave
Channel NewsAsia
February 11, 2022 Friday 8:06 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: Stretchers filled with patients. Doctors and nurses testing positive for COVID-19. Long shifts with no toilet breaks. Fatigue.
Healthcare workers at several hospitals across Singapore are feeling the strain amid a flood of patients seeking treatment at emergency departments, leading to long queues and waiting time for a ward placement.
""It's like Tetris blocks except it's stretchers filled with patients,"" said Jessica (not her real name), who works as a doctor at a public hospital.
""When you bring a patient in, you just have to find an empty spot to just push them there. It can be very confusing and hard to find them sometimes because it's just so crowded, so we end up having to shout their names to try and find them,"" she added.
Healthcare workers interviewed for this story were not identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media. Over the past week, hospitals across the island said they have seen a higher number of patients seeking medical attention at their emergency rooms.
Khoo Teck Puat Hospital told CNA that the average daily attendance at its emergency department rose by 20 per cent in the first week of February compared with January.
Of the patients who walked into its emergency room that week, 66 per cent were discharged without being hospitalised, said its spokesperson.
At Singapore General Hospital (SGH), the emergency department is seeing a ""higher than usual"" daily patient average than in the past two years, said Associate Professor Kenneth Tan, head and senior consultant at SGH's emergency medicine department.
Patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infections doubled during and after the first two days of Chinese New Year, of which more than 60 per cent were either eligible for the home recovery programme, sent to isolation facilities in the community, or discharged after their visit.
The Ministry of Health (MOH) over the weekend urged the public to seek emergency treatment at hospitals only for serious or life-threatening emergencies, amid a rise in the number of such patients.
Most of the patients who visited hospital emergency departments in recent weeks did not require emergency care, it added.
Hospitals that CNA spoke to urged patients with mild symptoms to visit their nearest clinics instead of jamming up emergency departments.
""Only people with serious or life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness and uncontrollable bleeding, should visit the hospital's emergency department as this allows those in need of emergency care to be attended to quickly and helps to preserve the hospital's capacity for those who truly need acute hospital care,"" said Associate Professor Thomas Loh, group chairman of the medical board for the National University Health System (NUHS).
NUHS manages National University Hospital (NUH), Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Alexandra Hospital.
INCREASED WAITING TIMES
Emergency department staff that CNA spoke to said waiting times have increased by at least 20 minutes to a few hours for mild cases. In some instances, patients have had to wait as long as 20 hours to get a placement in a ward.
Among hospitals tracked by the Ministry of Health (MOH), latest figures show that daily bed occupancy rates ranged from 61.5 per cent to 100 per cent between Jan 23 and 29. ""It's just chaos, with all the patients just waiting there and hospital staff members having to run around to check on everybody, while trying to keep up with the incoming patients,"" said Ada (not her real name), a doctor who works at an accident and emergency (A&E) department in a public hospital.
With space filled up inside the A&E department, it is also common to see a large pool of people waiting outside to get updates on their family members.
""It's very overwhelming,"" said Jessica.
""Whenever I go out ... everyone is looking at me and asking if their family member is my patient and whether I have updates for them,"" she added.
MORE PEOPLE TESTING POSITIVE FOR COVID-19
The growing strain on hospital emergency rooms comes as community infection rates continue to rise amid the Omicron wave.
Singapore reported 10,686 new community COVID-19 cases on Thursday, the third day in a row that daily cases came in above the 10,000 mark. The weekly infection growth rate jumped to 2.26, up from 2.0 on Wednesday.
A total of 1,212 COVID-19 patients are currently in hospital.
A&E doctors CNA spoke to said they have seen the number of COVID-19 walk-ins at their hospitals more than double, some of whom have mild or no symptoms.
""They are only coming in because they tested positive on their antigen rapid test (ART) self-test, or they might have something very minor like a runny nose or slight fever,"" said Ada (not her real name), a doctor working at a public hospital.
Under current health protocols, those who are well but test positive for COVID-19 are required to isolate at home for at least 72 hours, and can exit isolation once they test negative on their self-administered test and are feeling well.
As for those who are not feeling well and require COVID-19 testing, they can visit Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) for further assessment.
However, with many general practitioner (GP) clinics closed during the Chinese New Year period, hospitals said this might have resulted in more people turning to emergency departments.
""Generally, after long public holidays such as Chinese New Year, our hospital tends to experience a higher number of admissions,"" said a spokesperson for Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).
With reduced GP operations and people seeking medical attention only after the festivities, coupled with the surge in COVID-19 transmission, the hospital is seeing more patients at its emergency department.
""This is a trend seen annually,"" the spokesperson added. HOW HOSPITALS ARE RESPONDING
To cope with the surge in cases, some hospitals have set up additional waiting areas at their emergency departments or hired extra manpower.
At SGH, locums have been hired to augment the manpower at its emergency department.
This is to ensure that there is no compromise to patient care, said SGH's Assoc Prof Tan.
Meanwhile, NUH's children's emergency department and the NUHS hospitals have redeployed staff and increased manpower to support their emergency departments.
The hospitals are also referring stable patients to home recovery or community sites like COVID-19 treatment facilities where appropriate.
NUHS has set aside existing beds that can potentially be converted to isolation beds for COVID-19 cases, as well as more holding facilities for suspected cases waiting for their results, said Assoc Prof Loh.
""There are also dedicated facilities and manpower to support the care of COVID-19 patients. We are also offering alternative arrangements where clinically appropriate, including teleconsultation, tele-rehabilitation, tele-monitoring, remote prescribing, and delivery of medication,"" he added.
At NUH's children emergency department, the team is also taking on extra shifts to augment shortfalls where needed, said Professor Lee Yung Seng, head of the Khoo Teck Puat - National University Children's Medical Institute.
John (not his real name), a doctor in the children's emergency department in a public hospital, said most emergency departments in Singapore have set up a temporary tentage area because there is no capacity for the additional patients within the building.
""Everything inside there looks very rudimentary. The laptops are temporary, the fax machine is temporary. And then now we're seeing a huge number of patients in this area, it just looks very... not something you'd expect in a country like this,"" he said.
""This surge should've been seen coming. The resource allocation has been dismal.""
Rachel (not her real name), a nurse at a public hospital, said all the rooms in the emergency department where she works at are always occupied and manpower is stretched.
To cope with the inflow, the hospital set up an open area for mild and suspected COVID-19 cases.
She said that when it was first set up, there was just one nurse manning the area with about 30 patients. Now there are about three healthcare workers manning the area, which can hold up to 50 patients.
""It's not an ideal ratio, it's very stretched. My other colleagues from other areas will come and help but ultimately if they have their own patients in their area they still have to go back,"" she said.
She also said that she has seen more doctors and nurses test positive for COVID-19 themselves, leading to a further shortage in staff.
""Quite a few of my colleagues tested ART positive. If they're ART positive, they also have to be quarantined at home or in the isolation facilities. Because of that, we have quite a number of staff down,"" she said.
Hospital protocols have also been in a constant state of flux, leading to confusion among healthcare workers themselves, said John.
""I lose track also. We just wait for our department's bulletins on the official workflow and just follow that on a day-to-day basis,"" he said.
OMICRON VS DELTA
Despite climbing infections, Jessica noted that the proportion of COVID-19 patients developing severe illness at her hospital appears to be lower than what was observed during the height of the Delta wave in October last year.
When CNA interviewed her last year, Jessica - who works in the COVID-19 ward at her hospital - had described being pushed to her limits, with the situation so bad that she had to work for three weeks straight with no breaks.
""If you compare the Delta wave to the Omicron wave, it's slightly better because the proportion of patients who become so ill that they need ICU care is (lower),"" she said. ""It's an important distinction because you can have some severe symptoms, but you're well enough to be the general ward.""
""The concern is always ICU capacity. It's a problem (if it gets too full) because that requires very specialised care, and not every doctor or nurse can do ICU,"" she said.
""When it becomes too full, you have to get other doctors and nurses to come in, and that's when the standard of healthcare really starts to drop and people may die.""
BURNT OUT
More than two years into the pandemic, the current wave of infections is adding to the strains on healthcare workers, who are already exhausted and burnt out, they said.
""We've seen huge loss in nursing manpower and I can see my colleagues are struggling because (nurses) now have to take care of 12 patients each, which is double of what they used to handle,"" said Jessica.
""They have to wear full personal protective equipment while doing a lot of physical tasks like walking patients to the bathroom or feeding them, so you can imagine how hard it is to do that for so many patients, "" she said.
""Sometimes the nurses may not have time to change a patient's diaper or help them go to the toilet because they are busy with another person, and that's when they are accused of providing poor care and get harassed or shouted at by the patient.""
The constant stream of COVID-19 patients also means fewer opportunities for doctors like John to see other kinds of patients who come to the emergency department, compromising on their training.
""This adds to the whole feeling that we're burnt out. There's also a lot of talk about everyone just saying they want to quit, because the opportunities outside are so much better,"" he said, adding that many of his colleagues have already left the hospital.
His sentiments were echoed by other doctors CNA spoke to, who shared experiences such as working up to 13 hours with no toilet breaks or having only a few minutes to grab something to eat.
""I've been on the frontline for nearly two years, so I've gained a lot of experience and feel more confident in managing the medical aspect of it now,"" said Jessica.
""But that doesn't take away the physical nature of a job and how fatigued you can get."" INITIAL: hw",Channel NewsAsia,13-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999948018900946}",en,0.9999948018900946
143,"Gut health key to avoiding runs from antibiotics: Study; It finds that lower levels of a bacterium raise risk of diarrhoea after taking such medication
The Straits Times (Singapore)
February 12, 2022 Saturday","If you have experienced a bout of the runs after taking antibiotics, the cause might lie in the health of your gut microbiome.
 This is the ecosystem of organisms that live in a person's digestive system, and comprise various species of bacteria and fungi.
 A study by researchers from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (Smart) found that individuals with lower levels of the bacterium Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in their gut microbiome - one of the most abundant strains of bacteria in the human digestive system - were at a higher risk of getting diarrhoea after taking antibiotics.
 The study took place over a four-week period in 2019 and involved 30 healthy participants who were prescribed a three-day course of orally administered amoxicillin-clavulanate, known more commonly as Augmentin.
 Their stool samples were collected and analysed throughout the course of the study. Lower levels of the F. prausnitzii bacterium were found in those who had diarrhoea than in those who did not.
 The finding is significant, as the onset of diarrhoea during a course of antibiotics can lead to patients stopping their medication prematurely and thus ineffective treatment, according to the study's co-author, Dr Shirin Kalimuddin, a consultant at the SGH department of infectious diseases.
 ""The problem is very real for patients who are unable to take amoxicillin-clavulanate because it gives them diarrhoea,"" she said.
 ""Knowing why may help us devise treatment strategies in the future to minimise or avoid such adverse effects.""
 The findings were published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal iScience last month.
 Globally, a third of patients develop diarrhoea after being prescribed with amoxicillin-clavulanate, which is used in treating pneumonia, urinary tract infections as well as other infections.
 As part of the study, the team developed a simple polymerase chain reaction test to determine the levels of the F. prausnitzii bacterium in the participants' stool samples.
    HONING TREATMENT  People respond differently to medication. Understanding this response and the ability to predict those at risk will help guide the development of point-of-care diagnostics.
    PROFESSOR ERIC J. ALM,   the study's co-author, on nailing down the effect of people's gut microbiome to help them reduce the risk of suffering from diarrhoea after taking antibiotics  This could help assess how prone a patient might be to developing diarrhoea if he were given broad-spectrum antibiotics such as Augmentin to treat an existing bacterial infection, said Dr Shirin.
 The study's co-author, Professor Eric J. Alm, said: ""People respond differently to medication. Understanding this response and the ability to predict those at risk will help guide the development of point-of-care diagnostics.""
 Prof Alm, who is the principal investigator at Smart's antimicrobial resistance interdisciplinary group, added that while much research had been conducted on how a patient's DNA might affect his response to medication, the effect of the person's gut microbiome is relatively less known.
 A solution, in the form of dietary fibre, could help individuals looking to reduce their risk of suffering from diarrhoea after taking antibiotics.
 Prof Alm said: ""There're myriad health benefits from increasing your consumption of dietary fibre and that's probably the best recommendation for keeping a healthy gut ecosystem.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),11-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999959796153374}",en,0.9999959796153374
144,"S'pore was major biological warfare centre in WWII; As Singapore marks the 80th anniversary of its fall in WWII, various groups and individuals are doing their part to keep the memory of their loved ones and others alive for future generations. The Straits Times looks at some of their efforts.
The Straits Times (Singapore)
February 14, 2022 Monday","Singapore was one of five major biological warfare centres operated by the Japanese during World War II.
 Laboratories here set up by Unit 731, Japan's biological warfare unit, not only bred rat fleas and used them to spread the bubonic plague to enemies, but also cultivated smallpox virus, malaria parasite and tetanus bacteria.
 New findings uncovered by independent World War II researcher Lim Shao Bin indicated that the Republic was one of the five ""permanent fixed stations"" of Unit 731, along with Chinese cities Beijing, Nanjing, Guangdong and Harbin.
 ""The scale of the Singapore set-up was not small. We were like a mass production factory for biological warfare bombs,"" Mr Lim told The Straits Times in an interview.
 He found evidence in the war diary of British Major-General W. E. Tyndall of the Allies' medical directorate, which stated the general saw about 300 hand centrifuges on one table in a Singapore laboratory, indicating the possibility that hundreds of technicians might have been at work.
 Mr Lim, who has been studying the topic for six years, will be presenting updates on his ongoing research at a public talk on Saturday.
 Unit 731's Singapore branch, known as OKA 9420, was set up just days after the Japanese Occupation started on Feb 15, 1942.
 Japanese medical professionals and their staff worked out of the building that is Singapore General Hospital's College of Medicine today, said Mr Lim, 64.
 He found out from researching Japan's national archives that the Singapore branch of Unit 731 was approved by then Japanese Emperor Hirohito.
 Biological warfare brought devastation during the war. In June 1940, 3,031 people in China's Jilin province died after being infected by plague-bearing fleas from Unit 731.
 In October that year, another 10,510 people died in Zhejiang province in the same way, said Mr Lim who found the death toll in a 1944 Japanese research report.
 Another key new finding was that the former Raffles Museum - where the National Museum of Singapore now stands - played a key role in the unit's research on alternative specimens to carry the fleas used to spread the plague.
 OKA 9420 used the museum's rich collection of specimens to conduct studies and animals such as hamsters, squirrels and guinea pigs could have been considered to supplement the supply of rats.
 In October 1944, Unit 731 transported 30,000 rats from Tokyo to bolster the local rat population.
 OKA 9420 had a research database called ""Hei"" of about 140 papers, 68 of which have been found by Mr Lim. In meeting minutes dated March 1944 from the Japanese national archives, Mr Lim found the Raffles Museum was tasked to develop a heat-free portable lighting device to help Japanese soldiers navigate in the dark during the Allied forces' air strikes.
 Dead firefly squids, commonly found in Singapore's wet markets, were likely used in these devices as their luminescence was not as noticeable as torchlight.
 In late June 1945, OKA 9420 suddenly vanished from Singapore - weeks ahead of the official Japanese surrender on Sept 12, 1945.
 Mr Lim's quest to uncover details of the Japanese Occupation is his way of finding closure to his grandfather's murder by Japanese soldiers in 1945.
 The graduate from Japan's Keio University started collecting artefacts related to the war when he was studying and working in Japan in the 1980s. He has donated some of his collection, including postcards, photos and Japanese maps, to the National Library. In 2004, he published a pictorial book, The Images Of Singapore From The Japanese Perspectives (1868-1941).
 After retiring from a senior management position at consumer electronics firm Sony in 2018, he has been devoting his time to his research work.
 He would like to find out more about the medical experiments Unit 731 conducted on live and conscious human beings, as documented by other researchers.
 While he has seen information on such practices in other countries, including Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, he is looking for more evidence pertaining to Singapore.
 Mr Lim added that research on Unit 731 could help the international medical community better understand and control the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.
 He cited a May 2021 paper in medical trade journal The BMJ, which said ""scientific evidence on human-pathogen interactions, such as data from Unit 731, can help epidemiologists better understand pandemics of Covid-19's scale"".
 ""My quest has not ended because some of these findings threw up more questions than answers,"" Mr Lim said.

145,"Machine by S'pore start-up can supervise, validate self-taken ARTs
The Straits Times (Singapore)
February 15, 2022 Tuesday","A local start-up has come up with an ""ATM"", not for withdrawing cash, but to supervise and validate self-administered antigen rapid tests (ARTs) for detecting Covid-19.
 The machine, developed by medical supply company Digital Life Line, is set to be trialled with two private healthcare providers here - Raffles Medical Group and Fullerton Health - for its scalability, The Straits Times has learnt.
 A spokesman for Raffles Medical Group said it is still exploring the feasibility of the project.
 A spokesman for Fullerton Health Group told ST that it is assessing the viability and deployment of the machine.
 One of the machines has already been placed at Fullerton Health's testing centre at Raffles City.
 Users must first collect a test kit from their healthcare provider and self-register by scanning their NRIC or passport at the kiosk. They must then scan the unique QR code on their kit for tagging.
 Once registered, they can perform their test in front of the machine, by following the steps on the screen. The machine's camera will also record the testing process for auditing purposes if needed.
 Digital Life Line managing director and chief executive Eddie Chng told ST that the machine is also suited to supervise those taking a saliva ART, including the Pasport test developed by Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore General Hospital and other institutions here.
 ""Even when the Covid-19 pandemic is over, the machine can still be used for other types of rapid tests, such as for influenza,"" said Mr Chng.
 Once the test is complete, the machine will take a photo of the ART cassette and the results will be automatically sent to the individual and the healthcare provider within 15 to 20 minutes.
 ""The machine is also equipped with a biohazardous-waste basket, and ultraviolet light for disinfection,"" he added.
 Each machine can handle 10 to 15 tests an hour, and can be fully operational for 24 hours a day.
 ""The automation will help our healthcare partners overcome their shortage of manpower and help cope with the increasing ART volume, in view of the fast-spreading Omicron variant,"" said Mr Chng.
 Having each test kit tagged to one's IC or passport also ensures that the results of the test cannot be tampered with, he noted.
 Mr Chng foresees the machine will be rolled out for pre-event testing at Mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions) events, as well as deployed at schools and at the airport, potentially for pre-departure testing.",The Straits Times (Singapore),14-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999966608635941}",en,0.9999966608635941
146,"Driver fined S$4,000 for knocking down Supreme Court employee who was crossing road
Today (Singapore) - Online
February 15, 2022 Tuesday","SINGAPORE - While driving in front of Parliament House last year, a motorist collided with a pedestrian after failing to keep a proper lookout when turning right. The victim, an assistant registrar at the nearby Supreme Court, suffered many fractures and was given 49 days of hospitalisation leave. On Tuesday (Feb 15), the driver, Gillain Liew Shue Ying, 43, was fined S$4,000 and banned from driving all classes of vehicles for five years. 
She pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt while driving without due care and attention under the Road Traffic Act. The court heard that the victim, Mr Paul Tan Wei Chean, was using a pedestrian crossing, which showed a blinking green man, on April 5 last year at about 6pm. Liew, who was travelling along High Street towards Parliament Place, made a right turn and collided with him. It was drizzling and the road surface was wet, with light traffic flow and clear visibility. Another pedestrian, who had been walking towards the junction and heard a ""thud"", called the police to report the accident and said that Mr Tan was injured and bleeding. He was taken to the Singapore General Hospital in Outram. A medical report stated that he had a ""fracture dislocation"" of his right shoulder as well as facial and eye-socket fractures, and other injuries. A plastic and reconstructive surgical team treated his deep eyebrow cut. The court further heard that his shoulder injury will affect his daily living until the fracture heals, which can take between three and six months. He was hospitalised for five days and discharged with 49 days of hospitalisation leave. Asking for the maximum fine of S$5,000 for the offence, a police prosecutor said that Mr Tan had the right of way, but Liew's culpability was low and she had a clean driving record. She had also cooperated fully with the authorities and rendered help to Mr Tan after the accident. In mitigation, Liew's lawyer Josiah Zee asked for a S$4,000 fine instead. He told District Judge Salina Ishak that his client's driving record had been ""unblemished"" for the past 26 years and she had ""learnt a heavy lesson"". Mr Zee noted that she was a single mother whose young daughter was often in poor health. When the accident happened, her domestic worker had called her to say that the girl had a fever, the lawyer added. ""That S$1,000 difference (in the fine amount) will go a long way in providing more medical care for her daughter,"" he said. Liew could have been jailed for up to two years or fined up to S$5,000, or punished with both.",Today (Singapore) - Online,15-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.99999550584171}",en,0.99999550584171
147,"Day out at Kusu Island turns into emergency rescue of man in water
The Straits Times (Singapore)
February 15, 2022 Tuesday","Mr Inigo Nicolas Ortiz and his friends were having a picnic on Kusu Island last Saturday to celebrate his birthday when they heard people shouting.
 At first, he thought they were fellow visitors having fun, but the 28-year-old quickly realised that something was amiss.
 ""We listened more closely and realised we could hear panic in their voices,"" the Spanish national told The Straits Times yesterday.
 ""They were waving towards the water and when I looked over, I saw a man floating in it.""
 Mr Ortiz entered the water without delay and swam to the man.
 The man was unconscious, and he thought he ""was carrying a dead body"", he said.
 As an avid swimmer with experience in free diving, he managed to keep the man's head above water and brought him to shore. He then tried to revive him. The man eventually vomited and started breathing again, said Mr Ortiz.
 The senior licensing and artist relations manager said: ""I was thinking of his family while I was carrying him. Sometimes, he was breathing but sometimes he wasn't. I was just hoping for a good outcome of the situation.""
 One of Mr Ortiz's friends, who declined to be named, said he was worried when he saw Mr Ortiz struggling in the water under the large man's weight. The 32-year-old engineer had also dived in to help the victim.
 With help from some people on jet skis, they managed to get the 28-year-old man onto a boat, which then sailed to Sentosa as Mr Ortiz felt they would get medical help faster there.
 ""I was running on adrenaline, slapping him to keep him from going unconscious,"" Mr Ortiz said. ""Slowly, he went from just breathing to mumbling a few words. He tried opening his eyes a few times, but you can tell he was not 100 per cent conscious.""
 The police said they were alerted at 2.37pm last Saturday to a suspected drowning incident involving two men off Kusu Island.
 One was the 28-year-old man rescued by Mr Ortiz. He was later taken to Singapore General Hospital by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).
 The other was a 24-year-old man who is still missing.
 After getting medical help for the man, Mr Ortiz returned to Kusu Island and learnt that there had been a second man in the water whom they had not noticed.
 Mr Ortiz's friend, who had stayed behind while the others were getting help in Sentosa, had searched the water for an hour for the second man with other beachgoers, to no avail.
 The friend said: ""It was devastating not being able to find the other person. I'm still very shocked and sad about what happened. It took me a while to get over it a little bit. It does weigh on you.""
 Mr Ortiz met the family and friends of the two men on the island. He told the brother of the 28-year-old that the man was fine and receiving medical help.
 ""He was in shock, he didn't know how to react,"" Mr Ortiz said of the brother.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
February 15, 2022 Tuesday","Professor Cynthia Goh, a pioneer in palliative care here, died of pancreatic cancer on Sunday night at the age of 72 - but not before having a say on how to spend her remaining days.
 Her approach exemplified what she had always championed and done - to help the dying live out their days as comfortably and with as much dignity as possible.
 Her husband, Dr Goh Hak-Su, 73, said that when his wife learnt that she had not much longer to live, they arranged a trip to Ireland to visit their son and his family.
 ""We had two weeks of wonderful time,"" he said.
 On her last days, Dr Goh said: ""She had the best palliative care from her friends and colleagues. She was able to die at home, which she wanted.""
 Dr Goh, 73, said his wife was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in November 2019. She underwent surgery and chemotherapy till May 2020. In November last year, it was found that the cancer had spread to other parts of her body.
 Prof Goh, one of the trailblazers in setting up hospice care and introducing palliative care in Singapore, started out as a volunteer at St Joseph's Home in 1986.
 She helped to set up palliative care services at Singapore General Hospital and National Cancer Centre Singapore in 1999, and was founding president of HCA Hospice Care, the country's largest home hospice care provider.
 Prof Goh was born on Nov 21, 1949, in Hong Kong to a family of doctors. She attended medical school at St Bartholomew's Hospital, University of London, where she met her future husband, Dr Goh, in 1969. They married in 1974 and, after having a daughter and a son, moved to Singapore in 1981.
 The son, now a 44-year-old doctor, lives in Dublin, Ireland, with two daughters, aged five and eight.
 Throughout Prof Goh's career, she held various professional appointments and committee memberships. For example, she chaired the Asia Pacific Hospice Palliative Care Network (APHN) from 2009 before moving to the advisory chair position last year.
    THANKFUL  She said she was only given weeks to live. I think she was quite brave... she said she was thankful to God for enabling her to go through Chinese New Year for the last time with her family.
    MR SUNNY WEE,   a public affairs adviser, on his last communication with Professor Cynthia Goh.  Many who knew her have paid tribute.
 Mr Giam Cheong Leong, executive director of APHN, said: ""Prof Goh will be dearly missed but her light shall continue to shine and the APHN will hold her torch and pass it on to continue our mission of ensuring equity in access to hospice and palliative care in the region.
 ""She is a woman of strength, a leader with heart and a legend in palliative care.""
 Professor Eric Finkelstein, executive director for the Lien Centre for Palliative Care at Duke-NUS Medical School, said he is grateful for her guidance and support.
 ""Her dedication and compassion provided comfort to countless patients in their final moments and her energy and drive have transformed the palliative care sector in Singapore and internationally.""
 Professor William Hwang, medical director at the National Cancer Centre Singapore, said the staff are deeply saddened by the passing of Prof Goh, who was a well-loved and respected colleague.
 She held the emeritus consultant position at the division of supportive and palliative care.
 Mr Sunny Wee, 72, a public affairs adviser who had known Prof Goh for 18 years, said he last communicated with her between Jan 31 and Feb 1, when he sent her a Chinese New Year greeting.
 ""She said she was only given weeks to live. I think she was quite brave... she said she was thankful to God for enabling her to go through Chinese New Year for the last time with her family.""
 Mr Wee said that a few years ago, he asked her how she carried the emotional strain of seeing people on their last journey. ""She said that as a doctor, she can't show her emotion in front of the patient. But in her quieter moments, in a room where she can find privacy, she will let go of her emotions and cry.
 ""She said that she is also a human being and journeying with the patient over a period of time, you sort of get to know them.""
 Her husband, Dr Goh, said he will miss his partner. ""I will miss everything about her, we have known each other for more than 50 years... I will miss the companionship.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),14-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999977521345552}",en,0.9999977521345552

Channel NewsAsia
February 23, 2022 Wednesday 9:47 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: Nine hospitals in Singapore have confirmed the use of recalled Abbott infant formula products, and investigations are ongoing to determine the extent of use, said the the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday (Feb 23).
In a press release, MOH advised all public and private hospitals to stop the use of the two products - Abbott Similac Alimentum powdered infant formula, packaged in 400g tins, and Similac Human Milk Fortifier in 0.9g sachets.
The recalls - the Abbott Similac Alimentum last Saturday and the Similac Human Milk Fortifier on Wednesday - were issued by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) to Abbott Laboratories, due to possible Cronobacter sakazakii and Salmonella Newport contamination. Both products are from the United States.
Cronobacter sakazakii is a bacterium found in the environment that can survive dry conditions, such as dry food like infant formula and powdered milk, said MOH.
The bacterium cannot be spread from person to person.
Meanwhile, Salmonella Newport is a bacterium that can be found in many foods, including vegetables, meat and processed food. Salmonella can be transmitted via the consumption of contaminated food.
""Investigations are ongoing to determine the extent of use of the implicated products in our hospitals,"" said MOH.
To date, nine hospitals have confirmed the use of the implicated products. They are:
Gleneagles Hospital KK Women's and Children's Hospital Mount Alvernia Hospital Mount Elizabeth Hospital Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital National University Hospital Raffles Hospital Singapore General Hospital Thomson Medical Centre.
""We are working with the hospitals to identify and contact parents and caregivers of patients who might have received the products, to advise them on the actions to be taken,"" said the Health Ministry.
To date, the hospitals have not reported any case of adverse events arising from the consumption of these products. MOH said it will continue to monitor the situation closely.
SFA ISSUES RECALL OF AFFECTED ABBOTT INSTANT FORMULA PRODUCTS
On Saturday, SFA said Abbott Laboratories was directed to recall ""implicated batches"" of Abbott Alimentum due to the possible presence of Cronobacter sakazakii and Salmonella Newport, both pathogenic bacteria.
In another news release on Wednesday, SFA directed the recall of the second affected product - Similac Human Milk Fortifier.
It has an expiry date of Apr 1, 2022 or later. The code on the container of affected batches contains K8, SH or Z2, with the first two digits of the code running from 22 to 37.
SFA said the recall for both affected products has been completed.
Consumers may reach out to the importer, Abbott Laboratories at 6278 6220 or email family.sg@abbott.com for any clarification.
CAREGIVERS TOLD TO STOP USING IMPLICATED PRODUCTS IMMEDIATELY
Parents and caregivers of infants who have purchased the implicated infant formula products from retail outlets should also stop using them immediately, said MOH.
They should seek immediate medical treatment if their infants become unwell after consuming the implicated products.
""Cronobacter infections are generally rare,"" said MOH.
When associated with serious infections such as meningitis in infants, it may be fatal. It can also cause serious illness among people with immunocompromised conditions and the elderly.
For infants with Cronobacter infections, they may show symptoms such as fever, crying, poor feeding or lethargy. Some may also develop symptoms, said MOH.
For some individuals with Salmonella infection, they may not develop any symptoms, while others may have diarrhoea, fever and abdominal cramps. More severe cases may experience high fever, aches, headaches, lethargy, rash or blood in urine or stools.
Infants, young children under the age of five, the elderly aged 65 years and above as well as immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk of severe illness.

151,"Support is crucial for those on 'lonely' infertility journey, say IVF patients, doctors
Channel NewsAsia
February 24, 2022 Thursday 6:20 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: Ms Patricia Tan went through five years of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) attempts before getting pregnant with her daughter in November 2019.
The 38-year-old went through six rounds of IVF, each cycle requiring hormone injections, multiple surgeries, doctors' visits and blood tests.
Along with each cycle came the highs of hope that the process would result in pregnancy and the lows of finding out it wouldn't be happening.
At her lowest, Ms Tan, whose daughter is now 18 months old, found herself in what she described as a ""dodgy"" HDB flat alone with a man who claimed to be able to do some ""healing"" to improve her fertility.
The IVF journey tested her marriage, and she said that at the time, she didn't feel that her husband was giving her the support she needed.
""He was always there for me. It's just not the kind of emotional support that women, especially women going through IVF, can give one another,"" she said.
While he comforted her by saying it does not matter to him if they have children, and loved her without a doubt, she felt that her husband did not understand what she was going through.
""It's very difficult for husbands to know exactly what we are going through or empathise. I was on an emotional rollercoaster and those hormone injections didn't help,"" she said.
Through it all, it was the support of other women going through IVF, whether here or overseas, that kept her going, she said.
""We bonded ... We formed a community."" WHAT'S GOING THROUGH IVF LIKE?
IVF involves daily injections to stimulate the ovaries to produce mature eggs, an invasive procedure to retrieve the eggs, as well as another procedure to transfer the fertilised eggs or embryos to the womb, said Dr Serene Lim, a gynaecologist at Singapore General Hospital.
IVF can be financially, physically and emotionally demanding, she said.
""As the ovaries start to fill up with mature eggs, the woman may feel bloated in her tummy,"" she said. While a minority of women may develop ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, it is usually self-resolving, she said.
Emotionally, it can be ""quite stressful"" having to make sure that the injections are done properly and on time, Dr Lim said.
She added that some women might find the interval between the embryo transfer and pregnancy test - about two weeks - emotionally challenging.
""If the couple does not fall pregnant, the disappointment can be difficult to handle. Most couples who have not done IVF would understandably be anxious about the process, especially the woman,"" she said.
Ms Tan recalled the highs and lows of her journey.
""The emotions I still remember it can go up and down because sometimes when we have to scan, doctor says 'oh good result, I'm seeing a lot of follicles'. Then you'll ... have hopes and two days later it could be 'oh the follicles didn't grow and that's when the down (comes),"" she said. Dr Lim said that during the IVF cycle, the woman has to go to the clinic to undergo scans and blood tests to monitor her response to medications and top up medication.
She added that IVF is ""not cheap"". ""Even with government subsidies and MediSave, you may expect to fork out a few thousand dollars,"" she said.
Most women under the age of 40 would be able to achieve at least one pregnancy with three to four IVF cycles, Dr Lim said.
IVF patients who spoke to CNA said that the journey was a lonely one.
""The last six years before my daughter was born was nothing but isolating, very lonely, and very discouraging as well,"" said Ms Tan.
THE ROLE OF THE SPOUSE
Support from those surrounding IVF patients, especially spouses, is crucial, founders of IVF support groups said.
""The first level of support should come from your spouse, because they are the closest to you and they will go through the injections and all the scans with you,"" said Ms Dyan Razali, who started an IVF support group on Facebook in 2017.
Similarly, Ms Kimberly Unwin, co-founder of volunteer-run group Fertility Support SG, said support from husbands is important.
""It could be the male's (infertility) problem. But it's still the lady who is going through all the stimulations, injections,"" she said.
The hormone injections cause emotional ""turbulence"" and some women find themselves crying frequently, she said. But some husbands are not supportive because they don't understand what is happening.
""They don't understand ... emotionally or like, hormonally, what's going on inside of the female body,"" she said.
To help them, Fertility Support SG runs support groups on WhatsApp that have about 600 female members, and started a husbands-only group about two months ago.
""The spouse is the number one person who has to be very much supportive and understanding of the journey,"" she said.
SUPPORT AT THE WORKPLACE
The IVF community said that support from employers can also mean a lot for them and their partners.
Ms Tan, a headhunter, said she was lucky to have a boss who was understanding when she told him she was going through fertility treatment.
When she could not go to the office due to the fertility treatments she was seeking - whether it was IVF or visits to traditional Chinese medicine physicians - he did not question her.
""He just didn't ask me for my whereabouts and just told me to do what I need to do. He said if I need help, he's there to support or step in,"" she said.
He also supported her taking time off to recuperate physically and mentally when her cycles failed, Ms Tan said, and assured her that her job was safe.
""That was the support I needed. I've worked so hard to reach where I am. I don't think my fertility journey or temporary time off should impact my career,"" she said.
However, some women and their partners may struggle with finding such support. Dr Suresh Nair from fertility centre Seed of Life in Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital said that he has encountered men who break down because they don't know how to accompany their wives without support from their employers.
""They get criticism like 'why are you so special ... why you must spend time with your wife? My wife goes for checkup alone, why must you follow your wife',"" he said. He added that they may be mocked for being ""henpecked"".
Dr Nair has seen female patients who were not allowed time off work for their fertility appointments. He has spoken to such employers, and played hardball when they were not understanding, he said.
He said that couples having fertility issues need a lot more support at the workplace.
Besides having the support of managers, colleagues' support matters too, he said. Colleagues could offer to cover for those who need time off for fertility treatments, and such help should be reciprocated by the IVF patients and their partners, he said.
Employers can also play a part, as far as MP Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) is concerned. Mr Ng, who has three children through IVF, suggested last year in Parliament that the Government should offer gender-neutral fertility leave so that men can accompany their wives for appointments and show support.
Ms Dyan said that employers could also be more understanding of women who need to take time off for their frequent hospital visits, and also offer fertility leave.
For Ms Nur, who plans to start her IVF journey next month, quitting her job appeared to be the only option.
She was already feeling guilty about her colleague having to take over her workload. But it was her employer's response on how it would be difficult for her colleague to manage if Ms Nur had to take time off frequently for IVF that steeled her resolve to leave, she said.
Open communication with the human resources department and direct supervisors is important, said executive director of the Singapore Human Resources Institute Alvin Goh.
""I strongly believe that we can be more empathetic to our fellow colleagues who are going through IVF to provide more annual leave if needed,"" he said.
The most significant impact lack of support can have is making a couple give up their journey early, Dr Nair said.
""IVF cycles are successful when you do repeated cycles,"" he said, adding that couples may give up after the first cycle if they find it too stressful.
Similarly, Dr Lim said that the woman may forget to go for her appointments or take her medication erroneously, which would affect the success of the cycle.
""Stress can have a negative impact on semen quality,"" Dr Lim added.
HOW TO SUPPORT SOMEONE GOING THROUGH IVF
Husbands need to be aware that their wives' hormones would be running ""wild"" and that this could lead to them experiencing emotions like fear, sadness and a need to cry, Ms Unwin said.
""They shouldn't say things like 'why are you feeling that way?' and 'Can you stop being like this?'"" she said.
She suggested saying things like ""I don't know what you are going through at the moment but I will be here for you"".
But if he can't find the words, he should stay quiet and be there for her, she said.
""Small things like that really make a difference. Just knowing that we aren't going through this alone makes the journey a bit easier,"" she said.
During the two-week wait after the embryo has been transferred into the womb - a time of high anxiety - Ms Unwin said husbands should take their wives' minds off thinking about the success of the cycle.
In the event that the cycle fails, it's important for the men to see their wives through their sadness, she said.
Finding out more about IVF is one way of supporting a friend going through the process, Ms Dyan said. Sending foods like chicken essence and confinement food that is typically consumed during the IVF journey is also a good idea.
Ms Sueann Yao, also a co-founder of Fertility Support SG, said that colleagues do not need to keep mum if they know that their coworkers are going through IVF.
""If your colleague is very open to sharing already, as and when you can drop a text to ask how things are, let them know you are there. Don't suddenly keep quiet about it and think that nothing is happening to your colleague,"" she said.
""They should be more aware about how people feel when they go through fertility treatment.""
For Ms Tan, it was the words of encouragement, as opposed to sympathy, that helped.
""At that point in time, the words I found comforting were: 'You are strong, you are resilient, you can do it, I am here for you whenever you need me',"" she said. INITIAL: ja(cy)",Channel NewsAsia,27-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999946568751314}",en,0.9999946568751314
152,"Spottiswoode condo killer litter: Man admits hurling wine bottle that led to death of 73-year-old
Today (Singapore) - Online
February 25, 2022 Friday","SINGAPORE - A 49-year-old man pleaded guilty in the State Courts on Friday (Feb 25) to entertaining hostile thoughts about the Muslim community and wanting to startle a group by hurling a wine bottle at them from a seventh-floor lift landing in 2019. The bottle struck 73-year-old Nasiari Sunee on the head, then ricocheted and hit his 69-year-old wife on the shoulder. The grandfather of nine died in hospital the next day from his injuries, while his spouse was seriously injured. Andrew Gosling, an Australian citizen, pleaded guilty to one charge each of causing Nasiari's death by a rash act and causing grievous hurt to his wife, Madam Manisah, by a rash act. After throwing the bottle and shouting crude and religiously charged vulgarities, Gosling fled back to his unit. It took 10 days for him to confess to the police, after they questioned him thrice and took statements from other condo residents. 
He has been remanded since surrendering to the authorities. Principal District Judge Victor Yeo adjourned sentencing to April 8. Gosling's charges were reduced from more serious ones of causing grievous hurt to Nasiari with an instrument likely to cause death, as well voluntarily causing hurt to Mdm Manisah in a religiously aggravated act. Psychiatrists found that he was prone to obsessive negative thoughts when intoxicated but these did not represent his true feelings and intentions. THOUGHT ABOUT USING WEAPON LIKE GUN The court heard Gosling had entered Singapore on July 15, 2019 to seek employment. He rented a unit at the Spottiswoode 18 condominium around the Outram area shortly after applying for a work pass. On Aug 18 that year, he met an acquaintance for lunch where he drank a pint of beer. He returned home at 3.30pm and left his home again at 6pm to have dinner. At dinner, he had two large bottles of beer. He returned home at 7pm and drank another can of beer on his balcony which overlooked the fifth-floor swimming pool. He noticed a group of 10 to 15 people at the barbecue pits near the pool. He ascertained that they were from the Malay-Muslim community as some of the women were wearing headscarves. During investigations, Gosling admitted that upon seeing the group, it crossed his mind to use a weapon like a gun to shoot them. He then dismissed the thought because he thought it was a heinous act. At around 8pm, he left his unit to dispose of rubbish at the common rubbish chute at the lift lobby which overlooked the barbeque area. Upon finding an empty wine bottle in the rubbish chute, he hurled it towards the group. Prosecutors told the court that there was approximately 18m between him and the group at the time. He then ran back to his unit while shouting religiously charged vulgarities, which were redacted from court documents. He confessed to throwing the bottle for two reasons: As an act of mischief as he wanted to startle the group when the bottle shattered on the ground, and due to his anger at terrorist acts committed by Islamic fundamentalist groups in Bali and Melbourne that had claimed the lives of Australians. OFFENCE UNLIKELY TO BE RELIGIOUSLY MOTIVATED: PSYCHIATRIST Nasiari collapsed from being struck by the bottle, which landed on the ground intact. Paramedics who arrived at the scene noticed that he was semi-conscious and groaning in pain, while Mdm Manisah could not raise her right arm. Nasiari was taken to Singapore General Hospital in an ambulance, arriving in a completely unresponsive state. A brain scan showed extensive bleeding in his brain, multiple skull fractures and extensive haemorrhaging. He died the morning after the incident when his family declined to resuscitate him. Mdm Manisah suffered extensive bruising over her shoulder among other injuries and her arm was in a sling for two months. When police officers interviewed condo residents, Gosling told them he had seen the group at the barbeque pits earlier in the day but lied that he did not hear a commotion. On Aug 23, 2019, he was asked to go to the police station to give a statement where he only said that he had read the news about the incident but did not admit to his actions. He provided a DNA sample and fingerprints before realising the authorities could trace the bottle back to him. He then surrendered five days later. He was assessed in the Institute of Mental Health, where psychiatrist Christopher Cheok found he had alcohol intoxication and a past history of anxiety history but that these did not contribute to his offences and he was not of unsound mind. His state of intoxication had impaired his judgement to some extent but it was not enough to remove his culpability for the offence, Dr Cheok added. The psychiatrist's report, which was issued with the defence's psychiatrist Munidasa Winslow, also stated that Gosling was prone to obsessive negative thoughts when intoxicated, but these did not represent his true feelings and intentions. It was likely a product of his impaired mental state and ""not genuinely reflective of an anti-Muslim stance"". ""Even if he had committed the alleged offence, it was unlikely to be religiously motivated,"" the report further stated. VICTIM SEVERELY AFFECTED BY HUSBAND'S DEATH Deputy Public Prosecutors G Kannan, Thiagesh Sukumaran and Ben Mathias Tan sought seven years' jail for Gosling, arguing that he had demonstrated ""clear hostility towards Muslims"" and that his conduct was ""frankly appalling"". They also pointed to the financial and emotional impact Nasiari's death had on Mdm Manisah, who was in court on Friday with some relatives. The couple had been married for 45 years. Mdm Manisah took some time to come to terms with her husband's death and experienced flashbacks of the incident, the court heard. The housewife had been heavily reliant on his salary as a deliveryman. Her four children now give her S$700 a month for household expenses. She also cooks for her children and their families daily, asking them to collect the food so she would not be alone at home, and feels Nasiari's absence keenly during the fasting month of Ramadan. Covid-19 restrictions had worsened her loneliness, prosecutors added. Her 17-year-old grandson now stays with her on weeknights to accompany her. ""Although she tries to stay strong for her children, she would cry to herself when alone,"" DPP Thiagesh told the court. Gosling's defence team - comprising Senior Counsel N Sreenivasan, Mr Selvarajan Balamurugan, Ms Gloria-James Civetta and Mr Kevin Liew - argued that this was not a religious hate crime and that he had shown some level of obsessive-compulsiveness. Mr Sreenivasan noted that the only reason authorities knew what Gosling had shouted after throwing the bottle was because he confessed to it. There was no evidence that anyone else heard him. The lawyer also read out Gosling's apology letter to the victims' families and a Facebook post written by Nasiari's nephew, who had asked for a ""fair judgement"" and ""no bias against Gosling as a foreigner"". ""No amount of time or years spent in jail, or amount of fine imposed, can equate to losing the loved one we buried last week,"" the nephew wrote. Gosling grew emotional at this point, bending over where he was seated in the dock and wiping tears away. Those convicted of causing death by a rash act under the Penal Code can be jailed for up to five years or fined, or punished with both. Those who cause grievous hurt by a rash act can be jailed for up to four years or fined up to S$10,000, or both.",Today (Singapore) - Online,25-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999963418873989}",en,0.9999963418873989
153,"Stompin' Ground's Hafidz Samsudin a dynamite in hardcore punk scene
The Straits Times (Singapore)
February 26, 2022 Saturday","The singer of home-grown hardcore band Stompin' Ground, Hafidz Samsudin, died of a heart attack on Wednesday. He was 50.
 His mother, Madam Khatijah Abdul Wahid, 76, found him unconscious in his room at their Chai Chee Housing Board flat at about 2pm. He was taken to Singapore General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The death certificate listed the cause as ischaemic heart disease.
 According to Madam Khatijah, the bachelor, whose full name was Mohammad Hafidz Samsudin, had a history of heart ailments and had been hospitalised several times. He was the eldest of her four children.
 Hafidz was the co-founder of Stompin' Ground, a band formed in 1988 by a group of skateboarders that spearheaded Singapore's then burgeoning hardcore punk scene.
 The Lasalle College of the Arts graduate sang on the band's first demo cassette Grey (1990) and debut CD We Set The Pace (1993), released under Skin, an imprint of Japanese record label Pony Canyon.
 In a 1993 review, the late music critic Chris Ho wrote that the album marked the band's rise ""from a little hardcore hopeful to an impressive frontlining band in Singapore underground-rock"".
 In 1995, their second album Measured By The Richter Scale peaked at No. 2 on the Australian Billboard Metal Charts.
 While their music was heavy and loud, their lyrics touched on issues such as environmentalism, animal abuse, the downsides of substance abuse and the value of friendships. Hafidz wrote most of the lyrics.
 The band were also known for their dynamic stage presence, and Hafidz's restless leaps and headstands became part of their onstage trademark.
 Stompin' Ground went on hiatus in 1996. Hafidz did not join them when they regrouped in 2003 and released another album, Vector Prime (2004).
 He started performing with the band again from 2006 until they played their final show in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2013.
 In 2012, a group of local illustrators, photographers and toy makers staged We Set The Pace: A Retrospective Of Stompin' Ground, an art and photo exhibition at The Substation that paid tribute to the band.
 Many musicians from bands that are part of the local underground music scene attended the burial at Pusara Abadi Muslim cemetery in Lim Chu Kang on Thursday afternoon. Among them was his cousin, Stompin' Ground co-founder and guitarist Suhaimi Subandie.
 ""He was a very easy-going person and a very good listener,"" said the 58-year-old. ""But when he was on stage, he was all rage and fury.
 ""I have never seen any other frontman in Singapore who can match his stage presence. Who else can sing while doing a headstand'""
 Stompin' Ground co-founder and bassist Syed Mahdzar Al-Shahab found it hard to accept that he would not be able to hang out with or make music with Hafidz anymore. ""I love him not just as a friend, but also as a brother. He always made me laugh. And when we were on stage together, I would always feed off his energy.""
 Syed, 49, added that he would never forget how happy the whole band were when the members reunited for a jam session in 2018 at TNT, the music studio they used to practise at, to mark the 30th year of their formation.
 Hafidz's singing and performing style was influential on other frontmen in the home-grown hardcore punk scene, such as Voiceout and LC93 singer Izar Ahmad, 46.
 ""The first time I watched them play live, it turned my heart inside out and made me want to be part of the hardcore scene,"" he said, singling out Hafidz's performance as the band's highlight.
 ""I watched diligently his moves, vocal prowess, his intimacy with the crowd. He was always full of energy, always on the move. His energy was raw and full of sincerity.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),25-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999960828571111}",en,0.9999960828571111
154,"Jail for bus driver who caused accident where passenger's spectacles pierced her eye
Channel NewsAsia
February 28, 2022 Monday 4:09 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: A passenger on a bus was left in pain and unable to see after the impact from a bus collision pierced her spectacles into her right eye, which leaked a ""jelly-like substance"".
Three years later, the 67-year-old woman continues to suffer from sub-optimal vision in the injured eye, with permanent damage to her optic nerve.
The bus driver, now retired, was on Monday (Feb 28) sentenced to four days' jail and banned from driving for 18 months for causing the 2018 accident. He had pleaded guilty to one charge of causing grievous hurt by a negligent act.
The court heard that Phee Peng Yeow, 69, was the driver of a bus providing shuttle services to and from the Singapore General Hospital (SGH).
He was driving the shuttle bus in the afternoon of Jan 23, 2018 when the victim boarded. She sat in the passenger seat just behind the driver's seat.
THE ACCIDENT
The accident happened while Phee was driving behind another bus along Outram Road, near the bus stop close to the Health Sciences Authority mortuary.
The weather at the time was fine, with a dry road surface, clear visibility and moderate traffic flow, according to court documents.
The other bus was going at a slow speed because there were road works, and it was approaching a pedestrian crossing that was showing a green light at the time.
Phee did not maintain a safe braking distance when driving the shuttle bus, failed to keep a proper lookout ahead and collided into the rear of the bus in front of him.
Shortly before the collision, the victim had unbuckled her seatbelt as she was preparing to alight at the bus stop.
The impact flung the victim forward from her seat. Her head and the spectacles she was wearing hit a metal railing, which caused the nose bridge pads of her spectacles to pierce into her right eye.
""She was unable to see with her right eye. The victim felt liquid and jelly-like substance dripping from her right eye. She was also bleeding from the right eye and screamed for help,"" stated court documents.
Phee alighted the bus immediately after the collision to exchange contact information with the other bus driver.
He returned to the bus shortly after, and the victim asked him to send her to the hospital. He drove her to SGH's accident and emergency department.
Phee and the other bus driver both lodged a police report on Jan 23, 2018, the day of the accident. The victim lodged her police report in September 2020.
109 DAYS OF MEDICAL LEAVE
The victim suffered numerous injuries to her right eye, according to medical reports.
She underwent four surgeries between the day of the accident and April 2019 and received a total of 109 days of hospitalisation and medical leave, said the prosecution.
Her injuries included bleeding in the front of her eye with ""rupture of the penetrating keratoplasty"", or cornea graft. There was a splitting open of the wound and the iris suffered ""vitreous prolapse"".
Uveal tissue from inside her eyeball could be seen, with the vitreous leaking out of her eye.
There was displacement of the eyeball towards the back of the eye socket as well as contour deformity and volume loss. There was also ""hyperdense substance layering"" at the back of the right eyeball.
PERMANENT OPTIC NERVE DAMAGE
After the surgeries, the victim's vision and eye recovered gradually and the cornea graft was repaired.
However, she still suffers from sub-optimal vision in her right eye and requires regular management and follow-up. She also needs daily eyedrops to control her intraocular pressure and prevent graft rejection.
The victim had a dislocated intraocular lens and persistent vitreous haemorrhage. She also suffered from raised intraocular pressure that was ""unresponsive to maximum medical treatment"", according to court documents.
In addition, the optic nerve damage from glaucoma from her trauma is permanent. The cornea graft in her right eye was also slightly swollen with fluid, according to a follow-up in January 2021.
Deputy Public Prosecutor R Arvindren sought one week's jail and a two-year ban from driving.
He said Phee should have put greater care into driving, highlighting that the accident took place near a hospital when passengers were on board. The bus was also a heavier vehicle that required a quicker reaction time.
However, he also took into account Phee's good driving record and the fact that he had stopped to exchange contact information with the other driver and also sent the victim to the hospital.
Defence lawyer Ivan Tay asked for a S$5,000 fine and an 18-month driving ban, with no jail time.
Mr Tay said that Phee showed a ""high level of responsibility and civic mindedness"" after the accident.
He cited the fact that Phee lodged an incident report with his employer and a police report over the accident. After sending the victim to the hospital, he also visited her the next day.
District Judge Eddy Tham said that Phee ought to have exercised greater care when bearing passengers around the hospital, knowing that sudden impact could cause them to lose their balance and sustain injuries.

155,"Driver of bus jailed over accident that left woman's eye permanently injured
The Straits Times (Singapore)
March 1, 2022 Tuesday","After failing to keep a safe braking distance and proper lookout, a shuttle bus driver rear-ended the bus in front of him, causing a passenger to be flung forward and the bridge pads of her spectacles to pierce her right eye.
 The victim, 67, had just unbuckled her seat belt as she was about to alight.
 Yesterday, retiree Phee Peng Yeow, 69, was sentenced to four days' jail and 18 months' disqualification from all driving licences for acting so negligently as to endanger the personal safety of others.
 The court heard that the accident occurred on Jan 23, 2018, at about 11.30am near the Health Sciences Authority mortuary along Outram Road towards the Central Expressway.
 Phee was driving a shuttle bus to and from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) behind a bus that was moving slowly owing to road works.
 Deputy Public Prosecutor R. Arvindren told the court that Phee had failed to keep a proper lookout and maintain a safe braking distance, and collided into the rear of the other bus.
 The impact caused the woman to be flung forward from her seat, and her head and spectacles hit a metal railing. She then realised she was unable to see with her right eye.
 ""The victim felt liquid and jelly-like substance dripping from her right eye. She was also bleeding from the right eye and screamed for help,"" said DPP Arvindren.
 The woman underwent four operations between January 2018 and April 2019, and was given a total of 109 days of hospitalisation and medical leave.
 She continues to suffer from sub-optimal vision in her right eye and requires regular management and follow-ups.
 The damage to her optic nerve is permanent.
 The woman filed a police report on Sept 11, 2020, more than 2Â½ years after the accident. It was not mentioned in court why she had waited to file the report.
 Phee's lawyer, Mr Ivan Tay from Robertson Chambers, urged the court for a $5,000 fine, noting that his client had immediately exchanged details with the driver of the other bus, driven the woman to the accident and emergency department of SGH, and visited her the next day.
 ""This was pure negligence on the accused's (part) and there was no premeditation, no aggravating factors... He's now retired, there is no risk of re-offending,"" said Mr Tay.
 However, District Judge Eddy Tham said the fact that Phee did not set out to cause harm is not a mitigating factor for the charge he was convicted of, and he should have been more careful when driving passengers around a hospital.
 The court heard that the victim is seeking compensation for her injuries in a civil suit.
 For causing grievous hurt and endangering life by acting negligently, Phee could have been jailed for up to two years, or fined up to $5,000, or both.",The Straits Times (Singapore),28-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999973262846337}",en,0.9999973262846337

Today (Singapore) - Online
March 7, 2022 Monday","SINGAPORE - After illegally picking pandan leaves along the Sungei Serangoon Park Connector, Ahirrudin Al-Had Haji Arrifin was spotted without a face mask on and stopped by safe distancing enforcement officers from the National Parks Board (NParks). He claimed that he had the right to cut pandan leaves before turning aggressive, using a walking stick with a concealed blade to stab one of the officers in the chest. The two men then tussled. Ahirrudin retrieved another weapon, a karambit knife, from his shoe and continued attacking the officer, nearly severing the officer's thumb in the process. Ahirrudin, now aged 62, pleaded guilty in the High Court on Monday (March 7) to one charge each of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to the officer, possessing a scheduled weapon and breaching Covid-19 laws by failing to wear a mask over his nose and mouth. 
The first charge was reduced from a more serious one of attempted murder. Justice Tan Siong Thye adjourned sentencing to next week. The victim cannot be named due to a court gag order to protect his identity. The incident happened on May 4, 2020 during the circuit breaker period, a semi-lockdown imposed on April 7 that year to stem the spread of the coronavirus. People were allowed to leave their homes only for purposes like buying groceries. Ahirrudin, who has been remanded since the incident, cried and told the court he was ""sad"" when the charges were read to him. He had no prior criminal record. WHAT HAPPENED The court heard that Ahirrudin had decided to go to the park connector to pick pandan leaves for cooking. He hid two karambit knives - small curved ones with Southeast Asian roots - under the insoles of his shoes. He intended to use them to cut the leaves. He then cycled to the park connector with his walking stick, which had a 20cm blade concealed at the tip, and cut some leaves. Around this time at 11am, the victim and his colleague drove through the park connector in a buggy to install SafeEntry signs along the park connector. It was drizzling at the time. The victim then stopped the buggy near Ahirrudin upon spotting him, asking him why he had cut pandan leaves and why he did not have a mask on. Ahirrudin then questioned why he needed to wear one and said he was entitled to cut the leaves. When they identified themselves as NParks officers and said he was not allowed to cut the leaves, he remained insistent that he had the right to do so. They changed the topic but he grew more agitated, repeating that he did not have a mask and did not wish to wear one. The victim then photographed him as evidence and asked for his particulars, which he refused to provide. The victim then called the police. While waiting for police officers, the NParks officers again explained to Ahirrudin the importance of wearing a mask. In response, Ahirrudin cursed at them in Hokkien. When the victim tried to take a video as evidence, Ahirrudin saw red and retrieved his walking stick, stabbing the left side of the victim's chest. Shocked to see the blade partially embedded in his chest, the victim tried to pull it out but Ahirrudin climbed into the buggy and forcefully pushed it into the victim's chest. The victim's colleague screamed for help and tried to pull Ahirrudin away. The two men struggled and fell out onto a grass patch, with Ahirrudin dropping the walking stick. He then retrieved one of the karambit knives out of his shoe and slashed the victim repeatedly, almost severing his thumb. The victim's colleague picked up Ahirrudin's walking stick and struck him with the blunt wooden end several times but Ahirrudin continued biting the victim's right hand. He eventually let go and dropped the karambit knife after a passerby intervened. The victim managed to get up and fled with his colleague, calling the police to report what had just happened. Ahirrudin cycled home, washed up at the void deck of his Hougang block and hid the walking stick in a concrete compartment before returning home. He was arrested at about 1.15pm. The victim was taken to Changi General Hospital and later transferred to Singapore General Hospital, where he underwent surgery for his injuries that included his chest stab wound. He was hospitalised for four days. PROSECUTION SEEKING 12 TO 15 YEARS' JAIL The prosecution pressed for 12 to 15 years' jail, calling it a ""really egregious and aggravated case"". Deputy Public Prosecutor Senthilkumaran Sabapathy noted the extent of the victim's injuries. He suffered permanent impairment to both hands and still feels pain in his fingers, while his chest wound - to the left and close to his heart - could have ""easily resulted in death"", the prosecutor added. He required months of therapy with a hand specialist to restore motion to his hands. His left hand has a grip strength of 70 per cent in comparison to his right. The victim also still feels uneasy approaching members of the public, and feels afraid when he sees a knife even within the confines of his home, DPP Sabapathy said. The prosecutor added: ""Covid-19 was still novel and we were very reliant on safe distancing officers to protect us by enforcing the rules. What his actions did undermined that entire exercise. ""It was an incident that affected the country as a whole and our fight against Covid-19 by undermining safety and confidence in safe distancing officers."" In mitigation, Ahirrudin's lawyer Rajan Supramaniam said that his client has ""expressed profound remorse and regret"" and has been praying for the victim's quick recovery and good health. Ahirrudin acted in the heat of the moment and is not an aggressive person by nature, the defence added, stressing that he had fully cooperated with the police and did not resist arrest. ""He fled the scene out of panic and he was confused as to what to do,"" Mr Supramaniam added. Those convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by a dangerous weapon or means can be jailed for life or up to 15 years.

March 9, 2022 Wednesday 6:55 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: Three people were found unconscious in a room after a ""raging"" fire at New Upper Changi Road on Wednesday (Mar 9) afternoon, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).
The fire broke out in a unit on the fourth floor of Block 27, New Upper Changi Road and involved the contents of a living room, said SCDF in a Facebook post.
The fire was raging when firefighters arrived, said SCDF, who responded to the incident at about 1.15pm.
One of the occupants, who had self-evacuated with a baby, informed the firefighters that there were still people in the burning unit.
""A few firefighters swiftly made their way into the burning unit and rescued three unconscious persons from a room while other firefighters battled the fire to prevent it from spreading,"" said SCDF.
One of the occupants, a woman, was not breathing.
SCDF emergency medical services personnel performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on her, and she was subsequently taken to Changi General Hospital. A woman from a neighbouring unit also suffered burn injuries on her shoulder while self-evacuating before SCDF's arrival.
In all, a total of four people were taken to Changi General Hospital and Singapore General Hospital.
About 50 residents were evacuated by the police as a precautionary measure, SCDF said.
The fire was extinguished with one water jet.
""Preliminary investigation into the cause of the fire indicates that it was of electrical origin from a personal mobility device (PMD) which was charging in the living room at the time of the fire,"" said SCDF.
Two power assisted bicycles - one in the unit and another outside - were also found, it added.

158,"AI gives lab edge in detecting, tracking heart disease; National Heart Centre's new facility can predict disease more quickly and precisely
The Straits Times (Singapore)
March 9, 2022 Wednesday","The National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS) has launched a cardiac imaging research laboratory that harnesses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and predict heart disease more quickly and precisely.
 Launched yesterday, the Cardiovascular Systems Imaging and Artificial Intelligence (CVS.AI) lab is the first of its kind to be set up by a healthcare provider in Singapore and South-east Asia, said NHCS.
 The use of AI in detecting and monitoring the progression of heart disease could allow for early intervention and counter the world's top killer disease, which takes about 17.9 million lives each year.
 In Singapore, one-third of all deaths are due to cardiovascular disease - with 19 people dying from heart diseases or stroke each day.
 NHCS, which sees more than 120,000 outpatients a year, performed nearly 17,000 cardiac scans last year alone.
 These are images of the heart and blood vessels taken using methods such as magnetic resonance imaging, computerised tomography and nuclear imaging.
 The structure and function of the heart and its arteries can be analysed from these scans, which can lead, for instance, to the detection of plaque on artery walls or heart muscle damage due to blocked blood supply.
 ""AI can potentially capture and make sense of complex information in a multidimensional manner that cannot be done by a human interpreter - improving predictive ability and reducing labour-and time-intensive processes in analysing scan images,"" said Assistant Professor Lohendran Baskaran, clinical lead at CVS.AI and a consultant at NHCS.
 Not only can AI analyse the images to a greater level of detail such that it identifies even subtle changes that would escape detection by the human eye, but it also does this in a fraction of the time that a radiologist would take - mere minutes, compared with between two and four hours.
 NHCS medical director Terrance Chua said this allows for more precise assessment of patients' risk of heart disease, allowing doctors to prescribe preventive treatments effectively.
 ""Over time, this can potentially save costs, broaden accessibility of cardiac scans to patients, and improve overall healthcare for our population,"" Professor Chua added.
 Prof Baskaran also said that CVS.AI is armed with the technical hardware and software to securely transmit, store and process patients' information.
 The lab's technical lead, Associate Professor Zhong Liang - who is also principal investigator of NHRIS - said that its location at the National Heart Research Institute Singapore (NHRIS) at NHCS on the Singapore General Hospital Campus also ""allows for a constant influx of real-world data and daily information that can go towards helping the AI algorithms improve"".
 This is not the first time that AI has been used in cardiology in Singapore.

159,"Person dead after fire at New Upper Changi Road flat
Channel NewsAsia
March 10, 2022 Thursday 11:16 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: One of the family members who lived in a New Upper Changi Road flat where a fire broke out on Wednesday (Mar 9) has died, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Thursday.
A family of nine lived in the fourth-storey flat, said Mr Heng, who is also Member of Parliament for East Coast GRC.
The family has since been given a temporary space to stay, he said.
""I visited the family today, and was saddened to hear that one of the family members had passed on in the hospital. My sincere condolences for their loss,"" said Mr Heng.
Three people were found unconscious in the flat after a ""raging"" fire on Wednesday afternoon, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).
One of the occupants, who had self-evacuated with a baby, informed the firefighters that there were still people in the burning unit. Three unconscious people from a room were rescued from the burning flat.
A woman from a neighbouring unit also suffered burn injuries on her shoulder while self-evacuating.
A total of four people were taken to Changi General Hospital and Singapore General Hospital.
Preliminary investigations indicate the cause of the fire was of electrical origin from a personal mobility device (PMD) that was charging in the living room at the time of the incident, said SCDF on Wednesday.
There were also two power assisted bicycles - one in the unit and another outside. Mr Heng said on Thursday that the family has been provided with essential items after the fire, and that his team is following up with the family.
""Extremely heartened by the way the Bedok community rallied together after a tragic and unfortunate incident yesterday,"" said Mr Heng.
""This incident has brought out the kampung spirit in the community, but it is also a reminder to us all about the potential fire risk of personal mobility devices,"" he added. INITIAL: aj(mi)",Channel NewsAsia,15-03-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999975146092298}",en,0.9999975146092298
160,"MOH to pilot virtual wards for more medical conditions; Project to involve 2,000 patients with illnesses including diabetes, pneumonia
The Straits Times (Singapore)
March 10, 2022 Thursday","Following the success of the Covid-19 virtual wards programme, where patients who would otherwise be ineligible for home recovery were telemonitored and allowed to safely recover at home, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is looking at a similar set-up for other medical conditions.
 The Covid-19 virtual wards at the National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) have helped more than 700 patients and saved more than 5,000 hospital bed days.
 Patients under the programme are prompted via chatbots or phone calls to check their vital signs - such as oxygen saturation and temperature - regularly.
 A similar initiative under the MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT) called MIC@Home will be launched in the first half of this year for patients with other medical conditions and for those who require post-operative care.
 These conditions include diabetes and hypertension, pneumonia, urinary tract infection and chronic infections such as septicaemia, where bacteria enter the bloodstream and cause blood poisoning.
 These patients are otherwise stable but need to be hospitalised to manage their medical conditions until they are fit for discharge, said MOH yesterday.
 Mr Lai Yi Feng, the project manager for MIC@Home, told The Straits Times that three pilots will be rolled out, at NUH and Alexandra Hospital (NUHS@Home), SGH (SGH@Home) and KTPH (YH Medical Home).
 The project will involve 2,000 patients over a period of two years and recruitment will begin in the first half of the year.
 Patients must be 21 or older, and must have adequate caregiving support at home if they are not able to take care of themselves, said Mr Lai.
 MOH will then review the results of the programme before scaling it up to a mainstream medical service model to complement inpatient hospital care for suitable patients.
 Mobile care teams in the pilot phase will deliver selected inpatient-level services to the patient's homes, including teleconsultation, remote vital signs monitoring, regular visits by doctors, nurses and therapists, as well as intravenous therapy and simple blood tests, said MOH.
 Asked if there were plans to ensure that seniors or those who are less tech-savvy can use these telemedicine solutions, Mr Lai said that MOHT is working with multiple technology providers to make sure that is the case.
 ""We are collaborating with tele-and mobile medicine service providers such as Speedoc to augment healthcare manpower on the ground and reduce each pilots' reliance on limited hospital resources,"" he added.",The Straits Times (Singapore),9-03-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.999997883477138}",en,0.999997883477138

The Straits Times (Singapore)
March 10, 2022 Thursday","Three unconscious people were rescued from a flat in Bedok after a fire - caused by a personal mobility device (PMD) charging in the living room - broke out yesterday.
 When Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) personnel arrived at Block 27 New Upper Changi Road at about 1.15pm, one occupant, who had evacuated with a baby, told them there were still people in the burning three-room flat, SCDF said in a Facebook post.
 Firefighters entered the fourth-floor unit and found the three unconscious people in a room. One of them was not breathing, and was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation before she was taken to Changi General Hospital (CGH).
 A man identified himself as the one who escaped with the baby, who other block residents told The Straits Times is his nephew.
 He said: ""It is a tragedy that happened to our family.""
 He declined to comment further.
 A total of four people were taken to CGH and Singapore General Hospital, including a resident from a neighbouring unit who suffered burn injuries on her shoulder when she was evacuating before the SCDF officers arrived.
 About 50 residents were evacuated by the police as a precautionary measure, SCDF said.
 The fire was extinguished with one water jet.
 Resident Tan Eng Hok, 70, who lives two doors from the affected unit, said he was surfing the Internet on his phone when he saw smoke along the corridor.
 The part-time airport worker, who has lived in the block for around 10 years, said: ""It was very scary, I have never seen flames that big in my life.
 ""My maid and I quickly filled up buckets of water and tried to fight the fire. At one point, I felt the heat on my skin, but I knew I had to help.
 ""I don't know (the residents in the affected unit) but I had to help them.""
 Another resident, Mr Tan Toh Guan, 84, was reading the newspaper when his wife told him she smelt smoke.
 Mr Tan, a retiree who lives next to the affected unit, said: ""The smell got stronger so we just evacuated immediately. We didn't think about taking anything with us. We just wanted to be safe.""
 Ms Jen Reyes, 37, was working from home with her husband when the lights and fan in their living room suddenly shut off.
 ""I looked out the window and saw smoke. The first thing that went through my mind was that we have to get out now,"" said Ms Reyes, who works in IT and has been living in a corner unit on the third floor for a year.
 Ms Reyes, whose five-year-old daughter was in school when the fire broke out, said: ""It's a good thing she wasn't at home then. I think it would have been really scary for her.""
 Preliminary investigations showed that the fire was of electrical origin from a PMD that was charging in the living room, SCDF said.
 It said there were also two power-assisted bicycles, one inside the unit and one outside.
 It added that non-UL2272 PMDs and any form of modifications to PMDs pose a fire risk, and urged owners to dispose of their devices at appropriate recyclers.",The Straits Times (Singapore),9-03-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999959278714163}",en,0.9999959278714163
162,"Mixing medicine & melody
The Straits Times (Singapore)
March 13, 2022 Sunday","By day, they are professionals with high-flying careers in healthcare and academia.
 In their downtime, they turn into singers and musicians who play gigs, release albums and sing on television.
 Meet three Singaporeans juggling day jobs and music - medical officer Steph Yeap, dentist Samintharaj Kumar and political scientist Lam Peng Er.
  Doctor's double life as a singer-songwriter For Dr Steph Yeap, her two lives as a doctor and singer-songwriter have often intertwined.
 For instance, the 27-year-old, who performs under the moniker Stephycube, has a song called Emergency Room, one of her most-streamed songs on Spotify.
 She is now a medical officer in the ear, nose and throat (ENT) department at a public hospital.
 Because of her passion for singing, she developed an interest in laryngology, a branch of medicine dealing with the voice box.
 ""When I was a very young medical student, there were these ENT doctors I talked to and they saw that I loved singing and said, 'If you're interested in singing, you should do laryngology,'"" says Dr Yeap, who took piano lessons as a child and joined a rock band as a co-curricular activity in junior college.
 ""I found out that I really liked this aspect of medicine, which is both surgical and medical. It's something related to the voice, which I can incorporate into my work.""
 As a singer, she came to prominence when she was selected for the National Arts Council's Noise Singapore music programme in 2015.
 In 2019, the same year she graduated from the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, she released her debut EP, Most Of All.
 At the time, she says, she was ""doing my housemanship, which a lot of people would argue is quite a busy time"".
 ""But my main impetus for putting out the EP was because it was a passion project. I wanted to prove to myself and everyone that you could juggle both work and something you love.""
 Before the pandemic put a stop to live performances, she would schedule evening gigs in cafes, a few hours after putting in 30-hour shifts.
 Her music has been added to Spotify and Apple Music's curated playlists, and she has performed at venues including the Esplanade and *Scape.
 She wrote Emergency Room, which is taken off her EP, as a poignant tribute to her late grandfather. The then medical student was the first person to reach him when he was admitted to the accident and emergency department at National University Hospital.
 In 2020, the song gained traction worldwide when Spotify users added it to their Covid-19 themed playlists.
 A fan from the United States wrote to Dr Yeap and told her how his daughter - a dancer who had been admitted to the emergency department - was deeply moved by the song and ended up using it for a performance.
 While Dr Yeap has had less free time since the pandemic started, the music has not stopped.
 In 2020, she worked with Creative Nation Singapore, a collective by the National Youth Council, to come up with a playlist and perform for front-liners.
 Her most recent performance was in December, at a show celebrating Singapore General Hospital's 200th anniversary.
 At her wedding in the same month, she moved her husband - who is also 27 and works in finance - to tears by singing a song she wrote for him.
 She reckons her next album will be ready in two or three years.
 In the meantime, she is planning a collaborative album with musician friends and has been writing music that can be used commercially or sung by other artistes.
 She has also motivated medical students to pursue music.
 ""I have juniors come up to me who said the release of the EP and my social media presence have inspired them to pick up music and go for vocal and guitar lessons.""
  This singing dentist performs on TV Going to the dentist can be daunting for some.
 So while his patients are in the chair, Dr Samintharaj Kumar helps put them at ease by singing.
 ""Some patients are very stressed when l am doing surgery for them. You can see it in their eyes that when I am singing, they become relaxed,"" says the 46-year-old, who has sung multiple times on local Indian television and radio, as well as at events such as the 2000 National Day Parade and venues like community centres.
 For the chief executive of Nuffield Dental Holdings, singing is a daily affair - be it at the office or at home.
 ""I've quite a number of dental and medical clinics under my leadership. At the moment, we're talking about 13 clinics and a few other companies. It can be very stressful and people ask me, 'How do you run so many things and you are always smiling''"" Dr Kumar says.
 ""To relax, I sing a song that appeals to me. At the end of a busy day, music relaxes the soul and the mind. It's a very powerful way to destress both myself and my patients.""
 When he was in Anglo-Chinese School (Primary), his teachers were so impressed with his singing that they got him to croon on Tamil radio and television.
 In 1998, his singing aspirations got a boost when he became a contestant on the televised Tamil Talentime series, Uthaya Tharagai '98.
 Then a dental student at the National University of Singapore, he was a crowd favourite and came in fourth.
 He went on to secure invites to sing at live events and television variety shows. ""At one point, I was singing on television every week,"" he recalls.
 It was also during that time that the self-taught singer took formal lessons for classical Indian singing.
 Fans approached him for autographs. In an interview with The New Paper in 2000, he spoke of how one fan tracked down his pager number and left him multiple love messages.
 ""I was really passionate about singing at that point and actually thought of giving up pursuing a career as a dentist,"" he says.
 ""Then I spoke to my parents. I don't come from a very wealthy family, so it was better that I concentrate on my career first.""
 He also faced opposition in school.
 ""The dean of the faculty called me up and said, 'You shouldn't be singing, this is bad for you. Stop dancing on TV, it's bad rep. We don't want to have this reputation of dentists dancing around on TV,'"" Dr Kumar says.
 But when he was in Britain furthering his studies at the Royal Free & University College Medical School - now known as UCL (University College London) Medical School - the reaction from the school was the complete opposite.
 ""When they found out I could sing, they told me I was incredibly talented and wanted me to sing at more school events and shows.""
 Because of the pandemic and his workload, Dr Kumar has not performed live in the past two years.
 But he maintains an active presence on social media. He has a TikTok account where he regularly posts videos of himself doing renditions of Tamil and English pop songs, as well as a page on music streaming website SoundCloud with his covers of classical Tamil songs.
 During the circuit breaker in 2020, he composed an original tune titled In This Together and performed it for the In This Together Singalong Challenge organised by The Straits Times and e-payment service provider Nets.
 A few months ago, he sang on Tamil radio station Oli 96.8FM, taking on numbers by Indian singing icon S.P. Balasubrahmanyam.
 Dr Kumar, who is married to a teacher, encourages his 13-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter to pursue music as a passion - just like he did in his school days.
 ""It was a conscious decision to pursue dentistry, rather than singing, as a professional career,"" he says. ""But these days, for youngsters, the world is their oyster. There are many people who pursue singing professionally even though they already have a mainstream career - because of platforms such as YouTube and TikTok.""
  Political scientist to release his second album Six years ago, political scientist Lam Peng Er made headlines as the academic who dropped a rock album, Oceans Without Fishes, with self-written songs inspired by global events.
 He is no flash in the pan.
 The 63-year-old, who counts classic rock acts such as Bob Dylan and Electric Light Orchestra as influences, has recorded another album of original tunes which he plans to release some time this year.
 And while the first album comprises songs that referenced social and political events such as the Arab Spring in the early 2010s, Dr Lam wrote ""semi-autobiographical"" lyrics dealing with emotions such as joy and sadness for his upcoming album, Black Hole In My Heart.
 The principal research fellow at National University of Singapore's East Asian Institute (EAI) sings and plays some guitar on the tunes, which span genres from progressive rock to samba funk.
 Dr Lam, who started playing guitar in his teens and sang in his school choir, admits he is not a great singer.
 ""I really believe in the democracy of music. I'm not saying all music is good. I let myself be led by the heart and just let the cards fall.""
 He produced 300 CD copies of his debut album, most of which were given away to friends, associates and fellow academics. Some were sold at local music store Roxy Records & Trading.
 The album is also available on Spotify. According to statistics from the streaming platform, Dr Lam's top listeners are from Ukraine, Russia and the United States - three countries hogging global headlines now.
 ""I have no idea why,"" he says. ""But a Russian friend once told me that my songs' progressions and melodies reminded him of Russian folk songs.""
 Like what he did for his first album, he worked on his new songs with veteran musician Tony Goh from home-grown trio Tony, Terry And Spencer. The tracks were mostly recorded in 2018 and 2019.
 There was a small break when the pandemic hit, but when Goh's music studio, Greenroom Suite, reopened, the academic composed and recorded two more songs in 2020 and last year.
 Dr Lam, whose wife is a vice-president of investment facilitation at the Economic Development Board, roped in his 24-year-old daughter, a graphic designer, to illustrate the album cover.
 Since the pandemic, Dr Lam has been working mostly from home.
 Last year, he and EAI senior research fellow Ryan Clarke wrote a monograph titled Coronavirus Research In China: Origins, International Networks And Consequences. It was published by the Consortium of Non-Traditional Security Studies in Asia, a network of think-tanks and research organisations.
 He also took on a new position, setting up and heading Korea Centre, EAI's new research facility.
 The study room at home, which serves as his home office, houses not just a library of books, but also his collection of high-end, boutique guitars. These include an acoustic one he designed with local guitar store Guitar Gallery, with a Merlion emblem to mark Singapore's Bicentennial in 2019.
 Working from home means he gets to play his guitars more often.
 ""When I'm exhausted from frequent Zoom meetings, I unwind by playing my guitar and composing lyrics and melodies,"" he says.
 He has upgraded his audiophile sound systems, which are found in several rooms throughout his three-storey house in Bukit Timah.
 He also has a sizeable vinyl and CD collection that encompasses genres such as classical music, alternative rock, jazz and pop.
 Dr Lam is already planning his third album, which he says will be inspired by current events - most notably the pandemic and the crisis in Ukraine.

163,"First Parsi and Zoroastrian museum in Singapore opens in Desker Road
The Straits Times (Singapore)
March 16, 2022 Wednesday","Singaporeans now have a chance to learn more about the Parsi community, whose members number about 350 here, with the opening of a museum on Monday.
 Based in Zoroastrian House in Desker Road in Rochor, it is a showcase of the Parsis' history, traditions and Zoroastrianism, one of 10 recognised religions here.
 The two-floor permanent exhibition, The Joyous Flame, tells its story mostly through illustrated panels. Other highlights include objects that Parsis use in everyday life - a decorative silver fish-shaped object used to store sugar, and apparel worn during the Navjote, an initiation ceremony for children aged between seven and nine.
 Originating from ancient Persia, the Parsis fled to western India in the seventh century to avoid religious persecution.
 They trace their history in Singapore back to Mr Muncherjee, a supposed convict who was the first Parsi in recorded history to arrive here 200 years ago.
 ""We have never had this (museum) before, but as our numbers grew in the last few decades, the need was increasingly felt,"" said Parsi Zoroastrian Association of South-east Asia (PZAS) president Homiyar Vasania.
 ""We also felt this was important for our own community members to know more about their history and culture. We consider ourselves an important intangible cultural heritage in Singapore, and hope this museum is an important window to look into and understand us.""
 The exhibition is co-curated by PZAS with the Parzor Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation that focuses on Parsi-Zoroastrianism heritage.
 Since the first Parsis arrived in Singapore, they have become a wealthy and influential segment of society despite their small number.
 They are well known for their philanthropy and business activities. Among the most notable Parsis here was entrepreneur Navroji Mistri, who donated $1 million to build Singapore General Hospital's children's wing in 1952.
 The community faces a struggle to maintain a ""critical mass"" in numbers, Mr Homiyar said. For instance, it has no full-time priest for religious activities and there is no Zoroastrian fire temple in Singapore, unlike in India, where flames - representing Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrians' supreme deity - are kept burning 24/7.
 Zoroastrianism is the world's oldest monotheistic religion, and was among the first historically to preach concepts like heaven, hell, angels and demons.
 Its prophet and founder, Zarathustra, began teaching Zoroastrian tenets some time between 18BC and 16BC, and has become a widely studied figure for students of religion, history and philosophy.
 Perhaps Zoroastrians' best-known practice involves the Tower of Silence, where their human dead are placed in an open, circular, raised structure and exposed to the elements and carrion birds in a process of decay that they believe avoids contaminating the soil.
 They also claim the oldest human rights charter, the Cyrus Cylinder, placed by Persian king Cyrus the Great in Babylon after he captured the city in 6BC.
 It states that ""I freed its citizens from the yoke of servitude, I allowed no one to harass or terrorise, I set them free to worship their gods whose abodes I raised from ruins"".
 The original is now in the British Museum and its message of freedom of religion and tolerance has led to the display of a replica at the United Nations' headquarters in New York.
 Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong, who was at the Zoroastrian House museum's opening ceremony, said the Parsis are a very important part of Singapore.
 ""Despite relatively small numbers, the Parsi community has always been an active participant in Singapore's rich social fabric. It is a community both of deep roots and tall branches.""

164,"Private jet pilot jailed, fined for abusing police officers while drunk
Today (Singapore) - Online
March 18, 2022 Friday","SINGAPORE - While in a drunken state, a private jet pilot disrupted a group of workers doing cable installation works, and later went on to physically and verbally abuse police officers who detained him. On Friday (March 18), Cameron Lachlan Milne, a 40-year-old Australian, was sentenced to 10 weeks' imprisonment and fined S$5,000 after pleading guilty to one charge each of voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant discharging his duty, harassing a public servant and causing annoyance while drunk. Five other charges relating to the incident were taken into consideration during sentencing. The court heard that on the evening of June 14 in 2018, Milne met some friends for a drinking session at Boat Quay before heading to another bar at Pan Pacific Singapore hotel where he shared two bottles of vodka with his friends. 
At about 1.30am, Milne left the bar to buy water at a convenience store in Marina Square mall, where a group of workers were doing cable installation works related to the National Day Parade. One of the workers later saw Milne throwing equipment around onboard the workers' lorry and refusing to get down from the vehicle when asked. One of the workers also noted that the Milne smelled strongly of alcohol and ""stumbled around and spoke incoherently"". The worker decided to call the police because Milne was disrupting their work. The workers later alerted the national servicemen escorting the installation work for help, because Milne had tried to run away while waiting for the police to arrive. In the struggle, Milne fell into a bush and pulled one of the national servicemen along with him, tearing the other man's shirt in the process. Police officers who later arrived then arrested Milne for causing annoyance in public while drunk, after he gave incomplete answers when they asked for his details and address. While in the police car, Milne started shouting loudly and kicking in all directions, including the back of the front seats. He also repeatedly kicked the officer seated in the backseat with him. Sergeant Jamalul Ariffin Nordin sought medical attention at the Singapore General Hospital where he was found to have swelling, mild tenderness and a 5cm by 5cm bruising on his face. Court documents listed nine abusive and explicit phrases that Milne had used against the officer while at the back of the car, which was captured on a body-worn camera. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Theong Li Han sought a jail term of 10 to 12 weeks for the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty. She sought another two weeks' jail for an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act and a short custodial sentence for causing annoyance in public while drunk. In mitigation and asking for a lighter sentence, defence lawyer Anand Nalachandran from Forte Law submitted that the incident was truly isolated and ""very much out of character"" for his client, due to the influence of alcohol. He added that the incident was the only brush with the law that Milne had during his years in Singapore. The defence lawyer said that his client was visibly mortified after looking at the body-cam footage some time after the incident and had unreservedly apologised to the officers. In response, DPP Theong said that such self-induced drunkenness cannot be used as an excuse to not control oneself and so, no mitigating weight ought to be ascribed to it. When delivering the sentence, the judge said he took into account that Milne had a clean record before the incident and had shown remorse. He also took into consideration the character references submitted by the defence. The judge sentenced Milne to 10 weeks' jail for abusing the police officer, and handed a fine of S$4,000 and S$1,000 respectively for the offence under the Protection from Harassment Act and for causing annoyance in public while drunk.",Today (Singapore) - Online,18-03-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999990811001583}",en,0.9999990811001583
165,"Man jailed more than 13 years for stabbing, slashing NParks safe distancing officer in 'merciless' attack
Channel NewsAsia
March 18, 2022 Friday 4:28 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: A 62-year-old man who stabbed and slashed a safe distancing enforcement officer during an outing to pick pandan leaves was on Friday (Mar 18) sentenced to 13 years and four months' imprisonment.
Ahirrudin Al-Had Haji Arrifin attacked the National Parks Board (NParks) officer at Sungei Serangoon Park on May 4, 2020 after he was asked to put on a mask and told that he could not harvest pandan leaves there.
The 38-year-old victim's left thumb was almost severed in the attack. He suffered serious injuries to both hands as well as his chest, arm and scalp, undergoing surgery and receiving 89 days of medical leave.
Ahirrudin, who was a rag-and-bone man, last week pleaded guilty to one count each of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, unlawfully possessing a scheduled weapon and violating COVID-19 control orders by not wearing a mask.
He attacked the victim with a nearly 1m-long walking stick that contained a 20.8cm-long blade at its lower end, concealed by a wooden sheath. The judge said this length of a blade ""essentially transformed the walking stick into a spear"".
He also used a karambit knife with a 10cm curved blade, which was hidden in his shoe. He had brought along two such knives to cut the pandan leaves.
""The accused's attack was simply senseless, abhorrent and callous,"" said Justice Tan Siong Thye in delivering his judgment. The assault was ""brutal and unprovoked"", and a ""wholly unjustifiable response"" to the victim's performance of his official duties, he said.
The judge also pointed out the public interest considerations around the case. The attack took place during Singapore's ""circuit breaker"", when the work of safe distancing enforcement officers was especially crucial to stem the spread of COVID-19, he said.
""Such frontline enforcement officers were and still remain exceptionally susceptible to abuse and violence, yet they continue to place their health and personal safety at risk to enforce social distancing measures that protect the society,"" said Justice Tan.
He said the sentence imposed was necessary to assure public servants of adequate protection and vindication by the law when performing their duties.
""MERCILESS"" ONSLAUGHT
Details of the attack were heard in court last week. The victim was driving through the park connector in a buggy with another NParks safe distancing enforcement officer when he spotted Ahirrudin unmasked, with pandan leaves in his bicycle basket.
The two officers approached the man, telling him that he was not allowed to cut the pandan leaves at the park connector and asking him to wear a mask. Ahiruddin was uncooperative and grew increasingly agitated.
After the victim called the police and took a video of him, Ahiruddin unsheathed the blade of his walking stick and stabbed the left side of the victim's chest. He later entered the buggy and forcefully pushed the blade further in at least two more times.
Both men fell out of the buggy onto the grass. During the struggle, Ahiruddin retrieved a karambit knife from his shoe and slashed the victim with it, almost severing the man's left thumb.
Throughout this ""merciless"" onslaught, the victim did not retaliate and only tried to fend off his attacker, who took advantage of his vulnerability, said Justice Tan.
They continued struggling until a passer-by intervened. The victim, his fellow officer and the passer-by ran to Tampines Expressway to wait for an ambulance and the police.
After the attack, Ahirrudin cycled home and hid the walking stick in a compartment at the washing area of the void deck. He was arrested later that afternoon outside a convenience store.
Justice Tan questioned why Ahirrudin had so many weapons on him, saying: ""I wonder why the accused was heavily armed that day. If he wanted only to cut pandan leaves, he would just need a knife ... Why is there a need to bring along so many dangerous weapons for his protection, when his sole purpose was to cut pandan leaves?""
The judge cited a medical report stating that the stabs to the victim's chest could have been fatal if the blade had entered his heart. The victim's hand injuries could also have been life-threatening and caused a massive haemorrhage if not for the prompt medical attention he received. It was ""incredibly fortunate"" that this did not happen.
He also noted comments by Dr Kang Yong Chiang of Singapore General Hospital that the depths of the victim's wounds in his left hand were typically caused by ""industrial tools like electric chain saws"", and a ""large degree of violence"" was involved in their creation.
The injuries have caused lifelong effects to the victim, the judge noted. Despite months of rehabilitation, the victim still suffers diminished strength in his left hand and fingers, causing permanent inconvenience in daily life. He continues to experience psychological trauma and feels anxious whenever he sees knives, even in his own home.
In imposing the sentence, Justice Tan noted that the offender was over the age of 50 and could not be caned. The total sentence included three months' jail given in lieu of the 18 strokes he would have received.
The prosecution had sought 12 to 15 years' jail, arguing that public interest was one of the main considerations for sentencing, as Ahirrudin's actions ""undermined"" the safety and confidence of safe distancing officers.
In mitigation, Ahiruddin's defence lawyer had said the man was deeply remorseful and that his attack on the victim was impulsive, without premeditation. The lawyer had asked for eight to 10 years' jail. INITIAL: dv(rw))",Channel NewsAsia,21-03-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999982167775419}",en,0.9999982167775419

March 22, 2022 Tuesday","Madam Tan (not her real name) went to a polyclinic in January last year when she found blood in her stools. The 73-year-old had been constipated for some weeks, and laxatives had not helped.
 The doctor feared that she might have colon cancer and wanted her to undergo a colonoscopy - where an endoscope is inserted into the rectum and large intestine to check for polyps and other signs of cancer.
 She was referred to a specialist at Singapore General Hospital (SGH), but the appointment for the scope was five months away, in June.
 Fearing cancer, she did not want to wait, and turned to Dr Desmond Wai, a specialist in liver and gastrointestinal diseases who has a clinic at Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre. He saw her on Feb 3 last year and did the scope within the week.
 Her worst fears were realised. Not only did she have colon cancer, it was quite advanced and had spread to her liver.
 Dr Wai suggested that she return to the polyclinic with the results so that she could be referred to a public hospital for subsidised treatment. He assured her that other patients diagnosed with cancer whom he had sent back to the public sector were given priority and seen within a fortnight.
 But Madam Tan, who is single and has only the basic MediShield Life coverage, feared that any delay might cause her cancer to spread further. At the time, she already had a tumour in the liver, and it was big, at 5cm.
 When asked if a five-month delay in diagnosis would have mattered, Dr Wai said this could have resulted in more tumours, making the illness more difficult to treat. But he felt an additional two weeks before getting it treated would not make much material difference.
 Madam Tan's younger siblings, whom she had looked after when they were young, all agreed that she should get treated immediately in the private sector, and they and their children chipped in to help defray the cost.
 Dr Wai suggested that she opt for the cheaper six-bed ward at Mount Alvernia Hospital, which she did. The total bill came up to $50,000 to $60,000. MediShield Life, meant for subsidised care, covered only a fraction of the bill.
 After a few rounds of chemotherapy to shrink the tumours in her liver and colon, she underwent surgery in June last year, and is now doing well. No further spread of the cancer has been detected.
 Over the past two years, public hospitals had to defer non-urgent elective surgery to cope with the rise in Covid-19 cases. At the last multi-ministry task force media conference, director of medical services Kenneth Mak said public hospitals remain stretched as they deal with a backlog of non-Covid-19 patients.
 It ""reflects a debt that we had incurred over the last few months"", he said, adding that hospitals are now focusing again on providing care for these patients.

167,"Greater ease for SGH patients to track, collect medications
The Straits Times (Singapore)
March 23, 2022 Wednesday","Singapore General Hospital (SGH) patients can now track their prescription medicine supply using mobile apps, or nominate a more digitally savvy family member to help them do so remotely.
 The hospital has also tied up with social service agency Montfort Care to help patients living near its two family service centres in Telok Blangah with their medical needs, including having their medicine delivered to the FSCs for greater convenience.
 SGH said in a statement last Wednesday that it has digitised patients' prescriptions and enhanced its Medicines Order Service (MOS) on the HealthHub and Health Buddy mobile apps last year.
 Patients can now check in real time how many days of medication they have left and how much of their prescription they have yet to collect, empowering them to take charge of their health, said Ms Lim Ching Hui, a pharmacy practice manager at SGH.
 Previously, while patients could also view their prescriptions on HealthHub, they had to track their medication balance manually. Ms Lim said it is not uncommon for an elderly patient to lose track of uncollected medication, particularly if he is on multiple medications.
 Since MOS was enhanced last August, between 7,000 and 8,000 patients now use it each month to receive their medications rather than physically collect them at the hospital, said SGH. The majority are patients with chronic ailments such as hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol. SGH estimates that, should there be full adoption of the system, over 170,000 patients need not set foot in its pharmacy after seeing their doctors.
 While the option to order prescription medicine for delivery to one's home is not new, SGH said it has been running a pilot with Montfort Care for the past three months to deliver patients' medicines to the social service agency's centres near their homes. The pandemic has put the spotlight on how social service agencies can play a key part in meeting patients' needs, such as overcoming language gaps.
 Ms Wang Yu Hsuan, director of Montfort Care, said that its service staff are not only fluent in many languages and dialects, but also physically near patients' homes and can render support more directly.
 SGH said that it is working with other social service agencies to expand this service to other areas in the hospital's vicinity.
 To ensure its less tech-savvy patients are not left behind, SGH said it is partnering the SG Digital Office and has engaged digital ambassadors to be at the hospital to teach patients to use the apps.",The Straits Times (Singapore),22-03-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999954565225961}",en,0.9999954565225961
168,"Serial offender drunkenly assaulted 7-year-old son, pushed woman in front of oncoming bus
Today (Singapore) - Online
March 24, 2022 Thursday","SINGAPORE - Just a month after he shattered two of his neighbours' windowpanes with his fist over a long-running conflict, a man struck his son and caused the seven-year-old boy's front teeth to chip. This did not stop the man from committing more offences, some of them while he was intoxicated. He threw a clay flower pot from the third floor of a block of flats, before crashing into a pedestrian while riding his e-bike along a pavement several months later. When a quarrel broke out, he pushed the pedestrian's friend into the path of an oncoming bus. 
The driver managed to stop in time and avoid a collision. On Thursday (March 24), the 29-year-old was sentenced to 32 weeks - or about seven months - of jail time. While there is no gag order on his identity, his name was removed from court documents to protect his son who is a minor. He pleaded guilty to two charges of committing a rash act, and one each of breaching a personal protection order, committing mischief and voluntarily causing hurt to a person under 14. Three other similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. FOUND HOUSE SMELLY Court documents showed that on June 4, 2020, he pointed his middle finger at police officers who were interviewing him about his neighbour. He was drunk at the time. On Sept 27 that year, he and his wife had another dispute with their neighbour. They all lived along Jalan Bukit Merah at the time. He then punched the other man's windowpane and shattered it, before swinging his fist through the gaps of the neighbour's gate. The man's wife was then arrested for allegedly throwing bamboo poles from the corridor. The following morning, the man went over to his neighbour's unit in a bid to question him about his wife's arrest. The neighbour refused to speak to him and closed the door. Out of frustration, the man punched and shattered a nearby window that he mistakenly believed was the neighbour's. It belonged to another neighbour who was not involved in the dispute. About a month later on Oct 21, he went to his former wife's home where his two children - a seven-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter - lived. The children were home with their maternal grandmother. He was tipsy at the time, having had four cans of beer. He was also under a personal protection order that restrained him from using family violence against his ex-wife and children. He found the house to be smelly and asked his son to clean up after their pet cats. He then slapped the boy who began crying. He also pushed his son and caused him to fall face-down on the floor. This led to two of the boy's front teeth chipping off and a cut forming on his inner lower lip, which began bleeding. The man called the police himself after the children's maternal grandmother confronted him about the assault. He was arrested and later released on bail. His son had to see a dentist for fillings for the two chipped teeth. KILLER LITTER Nine days later, he went to visit a friend along Spooner Road near Singapore General Hospital. He had bailed his friend out soon before this visit, though court documents did not state what this was about. He then argued with his friend's sister-in-law before becoming aggressive. He abruptly took a clay flowerpot from a neighbouring unit and threw it to the ground floor from the third floor. It did not hit anyone and shattered upon impact. Then, on March 9 last year, he drank numerous cans of beer at a void deck of a public housing block before heading home on his e-bike. While riding along a pavement on Telok Blangah Rise, he collided with a pedestrian who was walking towards a bus stop with a 47-year-old woman. A dispute broke out and he hurled vulgarities at them. When the two women walked away, he overheard them saying they should not talk to him as he appeared to be drunk. He approached them and angrily asked if they were Malaysians. They did not respond and he suddenly pushed the 47-year-old woman on her shoulder, causing her to step off the pavement and onto the road in the path of a bus approaching the bus stop. The bus driver managed to stop. The two women boarded the bus to avoid a confrontation, while the driver asked the accused why he had pushed the victim onto the road. They began quarrelling and shouting, prompting the bus driver to alert his supervisors who called the police. The man left the scene before the police arrived, and was later identified. Deputy Public Prosecutor Norine Tan told the court that he had previously committed multiple offences. This included being jailed five times from 2010 to 2016 for crimes such as carrying offensive weapons in public, using or inhaling an intoxicating substance, and joining an unlawful assembly while armed with a deadly weapon. For voluntarily causing hurt to a victim under 14, he could have been jailed for up to six years or fined up to S$10,000, or both. For committing a rash act endangering life or human safety, he could have been jailed for up to six months or fined up to S$2,500, or both.",Today (Singapore) - Online,28-03-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999980176027671}",en,0.9999980176027671

The Straits Times (Singapore)
March 25, 2022 Friday","He had just enjoyed a meal with friends at a restaurant in Merchant Road and left the group to buy a drink at a convenience store.
 But in a flash, the financial consultant, who wanted to be known only as Mr Chua, was struck multiple times on the back of his head with a sharp object.
 He trudged back to his friends, who called for an ambulance to take him to hospital, where he needed about 20 stitches for cuts up to 10cm long.
 The incident happened on Sunday night.
 Speaking to The Straits Times yesterday about what happened, Mr Chua, 30, said he had no clue who attacked him.
 ""I'm shocked and clueless as to why I was attacked by a stranger,"" he said.
 He is recovering at home after his discharge from hospital on Wednesday and said he did not wish to speak further as he needed to rest.
 His girlfriend, who wanted to be known only as Miss Low, subsequently spoke on his behalf and said he still experiences sharp headaches and dizziness, and has had nightmares since the incident.
 Miss Low said Mr Chua was celebrating a friend's birthday with four friends at the restaurant near Clarke Quay when he left to go to a 7-Eleven to buy a drink at around 10.40pm.
 Said Miss Low, 26, a freelance designer: ""He was alone at the time and on the way there, someone attacked him from the back and struck the back of his head.
 ""He told me he didn't see who attacked (him) as he was in shock. We have no clue who did this and we are looking for eyewitnesses.""
 Mr Chua's friends were shocked when they saw him upon his return and called for an ambulance, she added.
 In a video posted on social media, paramedics can be seen tending to Mr Chua, who lay limp on the ground; his clothes and napkins around him soaked in blood.
 The Singapore Civil Defence Force said it received a call for help from the area at around 11.05pm and took a man to Singapore General Hospital (SGH).
 Miss Low said she later joined the friends at SGH, who were seated in a waiting area in tears, their clothes bloodied.
 When she saw her boyfriend, his head had been shaved and he was given some 20 stitches to patch up three large gashes on his head.
 She said her boyfriend did not know what object was used to strike him, but heard from a doctor that it was likely to be a sharp object.
 Mr Chua, who was given 17 days of medical leave after he was discharged, said he was well looked after in hospital and thanked his friends for their support.

170,"NUH apologises to woman who lost baby after two-hour wait; CEO says hospital should have done more, is reviewing processes to avoid such incidents
The Straits Times (Singapore)
March 25, 2022 Friday","The National University Hospital (NUH) has apologised for an incident in which a woman who was 36 weeks pregnant and bleeding waited at its emergency department (ED) for two hours and later lost her baby.
 NUH chief executive Aymeric Lim said in a statement on Wednesday night that the hospital should have done more to provide closer monitoring and care to the woman.
 He added that it is reviewing its process of managing expectant patients admitted into the ED so that such incidents do not happen again.
 ""She waited for two hours, and this should not have been the case in this circumstance, and we are sorry,"" said Professor Lim.
 ""During this time, we should have done more to provide closer monitoring and care, as well as to update the patient of her condition and the transfer.""
 The hospital's apology came after the woman's husband, a 37-year-old engineer, wrote on Facebook on Monday that no one attended to his wife after she arrived at NUH in an ambulance on March 15 and was left ""bleeding profusely"" for about two hours.
 The man said that after two hours, his wife, a 37-year-old financial consultant, was subsequently sent to a maternity ward where she was attended to by doctors and nurses. She was later told that she had lost her baby.
 Prof Lim said that the woman was admitted to NUH's ED that night at 10.35pm for bleeding, and was attended to immediately upon arrival.
 ""She was noted to be stable, and her bleeding had subsided en route to the hospital,"" he said.
 ""During the ED triage, her vital signs were within normal parameters. She indicated she was experiencing mild pain, and was assessed as 2/10 on the pain score by our nurses,"" he said.
 The woman was placed next to the nursing station for closer visual monitoring, he said.
 Patients in labour are admitted to the labour ward upon admission to ED, said Prof Lim.
 ""As she was in early labour, arrangement was made to transfer her to the labour ward as soon as possible, which was full at that time,"" he said.
 When she was finally transferred to the labour ward, the woman was immediately attended to, said Prof Lim. She was cared for by a team led by two senior consultants.
 ""An ultrasound scan showed the absence of a foetal heartbeat, caused by placental abruption, a rare and unpredictable pregnancy complication,"" Prof Lim said.
 He said the ED was experiencing high patient load at that time, and that NUH accords high priority to patients who need medical attention.
 He added that NUH was managing three expectant patients with Covid-19 in the ED and labour ward on the night of the incident. Prof Lim said hospital staff in both the ED and labour wards were kept very busy having to manage these urgent cases.
 Currently, all women over 36 weeks pregnant who have Covid-19 are admitted to one of three public hospitals for care and delivery. They are NUH, KK Women's and Children's Hospital and Singapore General Hospital.
 ""Despite this added workload, we have a duty of care towards our patients,"" said Prof Lim.
 ""It has been challenging to maintain the hospital's high standards of care amidst the Covid-19 outbreak, given the high numbers of patients admitting into the hospital for both emergent Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 clinical conditions.""
 The NUH team and its clinical and nursing leads met the family on Wednesday, he added.
 ""We are deeply saddened by the family's loss and will continue to provide care and support to them during this difficult period.
 ""(We) appreciate the opportunity to address their concerns directly. We will do our best to support them and ensure the patient's well-being,"" he said.",The Straits Times (Singapore),24-03-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999973121745245}",en,0.9999973121745245

A witness to the incident, who tried to extinguish the fire before firefighters arrived, told TODAY that he heard an explosion from the truck, which appeared to cause a lamp post to fall across the highway, blocking traffic. In response to TODAY's queries, the police said on Friday that they were alerted to an accident at about 11.50am involving a prime mover which ""self-skidded"" along West Coast Highway. 
The police added that the male driver was conscious when taken to the hospital. Investigations are ongoing. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said in a separate statement on Friday that it had taken the person to Singapore General Hospital. SCDF had been alerted to the burning truck at around 11.50am and had extinguished the fire using a water jet. The cause of the fire is under investigation. The eyewitness, Mr Abdul Farhan, had spotted the overturned truck that was starting to catch fire while driving down West Coast highway towards Pasir Panjang and stopped to help. Mr Farhan, aged in his 30s, the general manager of a ship inspection company, told TODAY that he saw the fire from the truck spreading to nearby trees and bushes, and decided he had to stop its spread before the fire worsened.

176,"Number of NCCS patients getting cancer treatment at home jumps 47 times over 18 months
Today (Singapore) - Online
April 1, 2022 Friday","SINGAPORE - Once every three weeks, Ms Arlene Cao, 47, sets some time aside during her lunch break for her cancer treatment. Instead of jostling with the lunch crowd to get to the National Cancer Centre, Singapore (NCCS), she receives the treatments in the comfort and familiarity of her home. A nurse would go to her home in Tampines to administer the injections and Ms Cao may choose to receive the treatment on her bed or in her favourite armchair. The senior software engineer, who now works from home, told TODAY: ""After taking my blood pressure, heart rate and temperature, the nurse would give me the injections and then take my vital signs again. ""After that, I can immediately go back to doing my work. 
To me, the best part about (receiving treatment at home) is the convenience and making fewer trips to the hospital."" Ms Cao was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer in 2018. She suffered a relapse of the disease last year and is now on targeted therapy. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, receiving treatment at home for a serious disease such as cancer might have seemed like a far-fetched idea. Even if patients can afford private nursing care at home, they will still need to go to a medical centre or hospital for treatment if it does not offer home-based treatments. Now, though, this form of cancer care model is a reality for more people in Singapore. Under the Home Care Programme of NCCS, the home visit conducted by a nurse is free for patients on the programme because it is fully sponsored by grants from various pharmaceutical companies for now. That includes treatment-related consumables such as syringes, needles and alcohol wipes. Dr Elaine Lim, senior consultant with NCCS' division of medical oncology who initiated the programme, said that in the future, patients may need to pay for the home visit, but discussions with the relevant authorities here are underway for them to make payment claims for this service through the Central Provident Fund's MediShield Life insurance scheme or as a deductible under Medisave, or both. In Ms Cao's case, for some example, the cancer drugs she takes cost her around S$2,000 for each session, but she does not have to pay for the cost of the home treatment service. Since the programme started in July 2020, NCCS has seen a 47-fold increase in the number of patients receiving treatment at home - from seven patients in the first month of launch to 329 patients in January this year. WHY PATIENTS TAKE UP TREATMENT AT HOME Certain cancer treatments that may be given as injections are suitable for the home programme. Dr Lim said that the centre had intended to extend its clinical service from the hospital to the community before Covid-19 struck, particularly for patients who were less mobile and required special arrangements such as an ambulance for their appointments. ""We were aiming for better access to care for patients, greater convenience and improved treatment compliance."" However, several factors sped up the mobilisation of the home care programme during the pandemic. For example, physical distancing regulations that came into effect to reduce the number of people in hospitals. Younger patients also chose to enrol in the programme because they wanted to avoid being exposed to the coronavirus, Dr Lim said. Another factor is the development of cancer medicines that could be given to the patient through injections under the skin or into the muscle, instead of via intravenous infusions, she added. Dr Lim said that for now, all NCCS patients are eligible as long as the patient's treatment is suitable to be administered at home. The treating doctor will assess and select suitable patients for home care and prescribe the treatment. WHICH OTHER PLACES OFFER HOME TREATMENTS Other than at NCCS, a home treatment programme for patients with myeloma to receive their chemotherapy injections is also available at the Singapore General Hospital. Myeloma is a type of blood cancer that develops from plasma cells in the bone marrow. The National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS) also offers a home care programme to provide some cancer patients with accessible care and treatment outside of the hospital and in the patients' homes. Dr Lee Yee Mei, an advanced practice nurse and head of NCIS' division of nursing oncology, said that under its programme, oncology-trained nurses provide services such as blood taking for blood tests, management of post-cancer therapy symptoms, wound care as well as selected chemotherapy and hormone therapies. Dr Lee said that NCIS' home care programme started in August 2015. However, the service was temporarily suspended due to resource constraints and restrictions in early 2020 when the coronavirus outbreak happened. ""We hope to resume the programme for select patients who need the service in the later half of this year."" HOW IT SAVES TIME AND COST Dr Lim of NCCS said that there has been positive feedback from patients on home treatment. Almost all (98 per cent) of patients surveyed said that they were satisfied with the service. About seven in 10 patients preferred home care over treatment in the hospital, while about two in 10 were undecided. Dr Lim said that some patients, especially the older ones, may prefer to still receive treatment at NCCS because it is ""like an outing for them, where they can meet and interact with other patients as well as the staff"". Reasons given by patients who preferred home care were convenience and time savings. Dr Lim said: ""Using subcutaneous Trastuzumab as an example, many HER2+ breast cancer patients are on this treatment for one year, once every three weeks, which translates to 18 treatment sessions a year. ""Patients would typically spend a few hours in NCCS for an injection. In addition to the time taken to administer the treatment, there would be time spent waiting in several patient touchpoints such as at the pharmacy to have prescription filled and at the procedure room. ""Other costs to the patient would be (two-way) transport expenses, the opportunity cost to the patient and caregiver taking leave from work, and for young families, the expense of arranging alternative childcare."" On the other hand, for the home visits, they typically last about half an hour, including post-injection and monitoring time. ""There are no queues and the drugs are delivered to the patient's home. ""The patient could be doing work - many of them work from home due to Covid-19 - or be tending to other matters during the home visit by the nurse,"" Dr Lim added. Receiving cancer treatment at home has some risks, but NCCS has safety measures in place. ""The risk is if the patient has a severe allergic reaction at home. However, this risk is low as patients receiving home care would have received at least one dose of the drug in NCCS and demonstrated no allergic reactions before enrolment into the home care programme,"" Dr Lim explained. All home care nurses are also trained in basic cardiac life support and are able to administer emergency care while waiting for an ambulance. Doctors in nearby clinics may be contacted to help in an event of an emergency. SECOND-TIME CANCER BATTLE Ms Cao is from the Philippines and has been working in Singapore for around 16 years. Her battle with breast cancer started in 2018 after she noticed lumps in her left breast. Life went back to normal after she underwent a mastectomy to remove the affected breast. Then, last year, she started experiencing pain in her neck and back, and collapsed while crossing a road. Scans revealed that the cancer had returned and spread. Ms Cao chose to be hospitalised for her cancer treatment from April to July last year because she was too ill and weak to look after herself at home. She was living alone. The travel restrictions at the time due to the pandemic made it difficult for her family members to enter Singapore. The isolation took a toll on her. ""My best friend had also returned to the Philippines at the time. I was alone in the hospital. It was a hard time for me. I recall my brother telling me over a video call, to face (the cancer) and be brave,"" she said. Her brother, who lives in the United States, eventually got approval to come to Singapore to look after her. He hired a domestic worker to care for her before he returned to the US. Ms Cao readily agreed to enrol in the NCCS programme because she felt that it would ""make life easier"" for her. The home treatments reduce the hassle and extra expenses of travelling to and from the hospital, especially on days when she feels more tired than usual. ""If I had to go down to the hospital for treatment, I'd have to take a Grab ride and that would be more money and time spent. I also feel that it is safer to get the injections at home than at the hospital (during the Covid-19 period),"" she added. She now goes to the hospital only for procedures or follow-up checkups. Scans taken in January showed that her cancer has ""almost cleared"" after the treatments and she is on the road to recovery, Ms Cao said. Not having to travel to the hospital regularly means that she may use the extra time to do the things she likes or to rest. The avid runner, who used to compete in marathons, has been brisk-walking every day to build up her fitness and endurance. She hopes to resume running soon. ""As an athlete who is used to running marathons, I relied on my endurance (to overcome my cancer ordeal). I managed to face my health situation bravely,"" she said. ""With prayers from my family and close friends, I survived - and now I'm here, breathing, walking, working and talking to you."" The Home Care Programme of the National Cancer Centre, Singapore (NCCS) was first piloted in July 2020 with seven breast cancer patients. They were HER2-positive and were placed on subcutaneous (injections given under the skin) targeted therapy Trastuzumab. HER2-positive breast cancer is a type of breast cancer that tests positive for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Dr Elaine Lim, senior consultant with NCCS' division of medical oncology, said that the programme proved to be very popular, and a few months later, other drugs were included in the list of drugs that could be administered under it. A larger group of patients are now eligible for the programme. It is available for patients on: Targeted therapy Trastuzumab (Herceptin) and Pertuzumab+Trastuzumab (Phesgo), which are essentially breast cancer treatments Hormonal therapy (Goserelin, Leuprorelin, Degarelix, Fulvestrant), primarily for breast cancer and prostate cancer Immune boosters (granulocyte colony stimulating factor), for all cancer patients on chemotherapy regimens that induce low white blood cell counts Bone-modifying agents (Denosumab), which are mainly for patients with bone metastases or are on cancer medication that induce osteoporosis ""In the future, we hope to include intravenous administration of selected drugs - this is being explored. The limiting factors are the complexity of the process and the capacity of specialised nursing expertise,"" Dr Lim added.",Today (Singapore) - Online,1-04-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999979608389293}",en,0.9999979608389293
177,"The day Marine Division pioneer felt like he was 'in a boiling pot'
The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 2, 2022 Saturday","Of all the missions that Lieutenant-Colonel Mohamed Nazim Kudin has been involved in during his 25 years with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), a ship fire near the Marina Barrage on July 16, 2018, is one he cannot forget.
 The fire started in the captain's cabin and spread to other parts of the ship.
 The 48-year-old said: ""As a ship is mostly made of steel or aluminium, the conduction of heat is tremendous. A fire can happen in one cabin and, because of the conduction plates, another fire point can flare up in a cabin three doors down.""
 He recalled: ""(The heat on the burning ship) was really intense. Even on the deck, I felt like I was in a boiling pot. I could see steam coming out.""
 Four firefighting vessels from the SCDF Marine Division were deployed and the fire was extinguished after five hours.
 No injuries were reported and all the ship's crew members were accounted for.
 Lt-Col Nazim was involved in setting up the Marine Division when SCDF took over marine firefighting operations from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore on April 1, 2012. He was the head of operations and training between 2012 and 2020.
 Yesterday, he was one of 10 alumni and pioneers to receive a medallion at the division's 10th anniversary celebration at Brani Marine Fire Station, near HarbourFront.
 Minister of State for Home Affairs and National Development Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, who was guest of honour at the event, said in his speech that as an international maritime hub with one of the world's busiest container ports - and the upcoming Tuas Mega Port project - Singapore is seeing threats in its waters multiplying.
 He said: ""These highlight the critical role that the Marine Division plays, and the need for the Marine Division to continue enhancing its capacity and capabilities to deal with the wide range of incidents.""
 Associate Professor Faishal thanked the past and current Marine Division teams for their unwavering dedication and hard work.
 When the division was set up in 2012, it had about 50 people, two vessels and one marine fire station - West Coast Marine Fire Station.
 Now, it has about 220 people, six vessels, two fire stations and two fire posts.
 Between 2012 and last year, it responded to 56 fire incidents and 77 rescue incidents.
 Colonel Ryan Ong, commander of the division, said: ""We will continue to build our capabilities and capacity by expanding our fleet of marine vessels, upskilling our officers and leveraging advanced and unmanned technologies for firefighting and rescue operations.""
 The event also marked the official operation of the heavy fire vessel Red Sailfish.
 The vessel, built by defence technology company ST Engineering's marine arm, is said to be one of the world's most powerful firefighting vessels in terms of water output.
 Prof Faishal said the Marine Division is currently testing the use of unmanned technologies - such as an unmanned surface vessel and an unmanned aerial vehicle - for fire and rescue operations.
 Meanwhile, the SCDF is set to open Punggol Marine Fire Post by 2025, which will improve response times in the north-eastern parts of Singapore.
 It also plans to expand its fleet to 10 vessels by 2029.
 Lt-Col Nazim, who now heads the specialist training centre at the Civil Defence Academy, said: ""In the longer run, we want to leverage more technology and see how we can reduce the stress on the firefighters, and be early adopters of unmanned technologies.
 ""Ultimately, everything should leverage technology. If I can send one less firefighter, I'm putting one less person at risk.""
  Three incidents handled by the SCDF division  SEPT 13, 2021 The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) deployed two vessels to a ship anchored to the east of Singapore after a crew member was suspected to have suffered a stroke.
 Seven SCDF marine specialists, including two emergency medical technicians, boarded the vessel and secured him to a stretcher before lowering him onto a marine rescue vessel.
 He was taken to Changi General Hospital for treatment.
  NOV 13, 2020 Two vessels were dispatched to a container ship anchored to the south-east of Singapore after a man fell down a hatch and suffered a serious leg injury.
 Two SCDF marine specialists placed him on a stretcher and then lowered him onto a heavy rescue vessel.
 He was taken to Singapore General Hospital for treatment.
  AUG 2, 2016 SCDF firefighters took seven hours to extinguish a fire that broke out on a large cargo barge docked at a shipyard in Tuas South Boulevard.
 Two marine firefighting vessels, among other firefighting vehicles, were deployed to the scene. The vessels were used to cool the exterior of the barge to prevent the fire from spreading.
 Marine specialists and firefighters then entered the barge to extinguish the fire.",The Straits Times (Singapore),1-04-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999967910727886}",en,0.9999967910727886
178,"Egg freezing gives women choice but doctors say it doesn't guarantee motherhood; The White Paper on Singapore Women's Development will be debated in Parliament this week. Allowing women to freeze their eggs for non-medical reasons is among the policy changes outlined in the 10-year road map. The Straits Times speaks to women who have chosen to do so. Factors like ability to carry pregnancy, egg quality affect chances of a baby being born
The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 4, 2022 Monday","Before travel curbs were imposed due to Covid-19, one or two Singaporeans a month would consult Dr Helena Lim at her clinic in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, seeking to freeze their eggs.
 The fertility specialist at the KL Fertility & Gynaecology Centre said: ""Most of them are single and some are in stable relationships but they are not ready to tie the knot and start a family yet. These women are well aware that their fertility declines with age and they feel strongly about having their fertility preserved.""
 Most of these women are aged between 35 and 40 and they pay between $4,500 and $5,500 for one cycle of egg freezing at Dr Lim's clinic.
 Women in Singapore have been going to places such as Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong and Australia for elective egg freezing, which is done for non-medical reasons, to preserve their fertility.
 The outflow may now slow with the Government announcing last Monday that women aged between 21 and 35 - regardless of their marital status - will be allowed to undergo elective egg freezing from next year.
 The move marks a major shift in policy, as currently women can freeze their eggs only for medical reasons, such as when they have to undergo chemotherapy, which may adversely affect their fertility.
 Before undergoing the procedure, those eligible will be counselled about the risks involved and told that it does not guarantee motherhood.
 And only married couples can use their frozen eggs to try for a baby through in-vitro fertilisation.
 Associate Professor Yong Tze Tein, head of the obstetrics and gynaecology department at Singapore General Hospital, cheered the announcement, saying: ""It will give women more autonomy over their choices in life. All too often, it is like it's a woman's fault if she spent time studying or pursuing a career.""
 However, she stressed that women must be properly informed about the procedure's risks and benefits and not be lulled into delaying motherhood.
 Prof Yong said a baby girl is born with one million to two million eggs, but by the time she reaches 35, only an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 eggs are left.
 Egg freezing preserves fertility as the age of the eggs remains unchanged from the moment they are frozen. A woman's chances of getting pregnant fall as she ages, as the quantity and quality of her eggs decline with age.
 Medical research in other countries has found that the chance of a frozen egg leading to a baby being born is about 2 per cent to 12 per cent, Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sun Xueling has said.
 She said these studies also found that a very small proportion of women - fewer than 10 per cent - use their frozen eggs in the end.
 Doctors interviewed by The Straits Times, citing overseas studies, say the number of babies born from frozen eggs is small as few women end up using their frozen eggs. There are also other factors affecting the chances of a baby being born even if the woman uses her eggs, such as egg quality and conditions that affect her ability to carry a pregnancy to term.
 Associate Professor Sadhana Nadarajah, head of department of reproductive medicine at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, cautioned that there are surgical risks involved in the invasive procedure as well as risks related to pregnancy at an older age.
 Prof Yong, detailing the process, said a woman has to inject herself with hormones to stimulate the production of more eggs for harvesting and go for ultrasound scans and blood tests for about two weeks. Her eggs are then retrieved using an ultra-sound-guided needle and frozen in the laboratory.
 The doctors interviewed have mixed views about the age limit of 35 for elective egg freezing. Ms Sun had said that the age limit is aligned with the existing egg donor age limit of 35.
 Dr Roland Chieng, medical director of Virtus Fertility Centre Singapore, described the age limit of 35 as reasonable, noting that a woman's fertility declines sharply after 35.
 He advises patients to freeze at least 20 eggs to have a good chance of pregnancy, adding that it may take one or two cycles to hit this number, depending on the individual and the age at which she freezes her eggs.
 Dr Loh Seong Feei, medical director of Thomson Fertility Centre, felt that the age limit of 35 is arbitrary, noting that the quality and quantity of a woman's eggs vary not only based on her age, but also differ for individuals of the same age.
 Prof Sadhana added that the success of the procedure is heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of a woman's eggs.
 Dr Lim of the KL Fertility & Gynaecology Centre said a few Singaporeans have given birth from the eggs they froze.
 Most had their eggs frozen when they were aged between 35 and 38 and gave birth using those eggs when they were around 40 years old. ""Their babies turned out fine,"" she said.",The Straits Times (Singapore),3-04-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999958515106375}",en,0.9999958515106375

The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 5, 2022 Tuesday","Lorry driver Lee Hock Peng was having breakfast at home with his daughter at about 10.20am yesterday when he saw grey smoke rising in the corridor outside his flat.
 He realised his neighbour's flat on the ground floor had caught fire.
 The 57-year-old, who lives on the second floor of Block 662 in Woodlands Ring Road, said: ""I told my daughter to call 995 and went to knock on our neighbours' doors to tell them to evacuate.
 ""I went downstairs and shouted to see if anyone was in the flat, but there was no reply. Some neighbours came with a water hose to help put out the fire.""
 Mr Lee also used a small fire extinguisher from another neighbour's flat to try to put out the fire.
 ""I couldn't go farther into the flat because it was really smoky and I couldn't see anything,"" he said.
 The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted to the fire at about 10.20am and firefighters put it out with a water jet.
 SCDF said the blaze involved items in one of the bedrooms of the ground-floor flat. About 15 residents evacuated from the block and two people were taken to Singapore General Hospital, it added.
 The cause of the fire is under investigation.
 When ST arrived there at 3pm, the corridor outside the flat was wet. Inside, the floor was wet with grey water, and the pillars and ceiling covered in soot. In the bedroom, there were charred remains of a shoe, a cloth and other unidentified items.
 Some workers from Sembawang Town Council, which oversees the area, were cleaning up the flat and removing undamaged furniture and electrical appliances.
 The flat's owner, Madam Mahaletchimi Govindan Nair, said that she, her 83-year-old husband and 40-year-old son have lived in the flat for 17 years.
 The 73-year-old cleaner said she was working when a friend told her about the fire at 11am. Her friend is a cleaner who works in Woodlands Ring Primary School, which is opposite the block.
 Madam Mahaletchimi said she rushed home immediately and added that no one was home when the fire broke out.
 Her husband, a retiree, was out for a medical check-up at the time and her son had gone out to buy some things.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 5, 2022 Tuesday","Visitors were happy and relieved at being able to see their loved ones again in hospitals and nursing homes as in-person visits resumed yesterday after more than two months.
 At public hospitals, including Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital and Singapore General Hospital, The Straits Times saw organised queues yesterday morning of about 30 to 60 people waiting to visit patients in the wards.
 ST spoke to some visitors, who said they were happy at the easing of Covid-19 restrictions and relieved that they could see their loved ones in the hospital.
 At Sengkang General Hospital, ST counted about 10 people in the line for visitor registration at noon. This grew to a snaking queue of about 30 people by 12.30pm.
 Signboards placed before the start of registration lines informed visitors of the relaxed measures, which now allow up to two fully vaccinated visitors at the patient's bedside at any one time.
 Ms Athena Low, 23, who was at the hospital to visit her university mate, said the relaxation of measures was a great way to improve the mental health of patients.
 Ms Low, who was warded last month for rhabdomyolysis, a serious muscle disease, said: ""I was so sad and lonely when I had to stay in the hospital for two nights with nobody visiting me.
 ""Having close ones visit is something that all patients look forward to and it really does improve our stay, which for me was very gloomy.""
 Long queues were also seen at Changi General Hospital, where more than 30 people were in the line for visitor registration for general wards at 1.20pm.
 Visitors had to fill in a registration form to declare they did not have any Covid-19 symptoms before joining the queue.
 At the National University Hospital (NUH), about 30 people were waiting to register for visitations at noon, with hospital staff ensuring that those in line stood 1m apart.

 The 25-year-old, who works in marketing, said: ""My grandmother has been hospitalised for slightly more than a month.
 ""She was happy to see me physically and it was so nice to see her as well. We live together and the house has been so empty without her.""
 Mr Clifford Yow, 56, who was at NUH with his father to visit his mother, said he had not been able to see her for almost five months.
 Mr Yow, who is self-employed, said his mother was admitted to the hospital after contracting Covid-19 and pneumonia.

Today (Singapore) - Online
April 8, 2022 Friday","SINGAPORE - A 49-year-old man was jailed for five-and-a-half years on Friday (April 8) for hurling a wine bottle from a condominium seventh-floor lift landing, which struck a grandfather on the head and killed him. Andrew Gosling had hostile thoughts about the Muslim community while drunk and wanted to startle a family who was gathered at the barbecue pits near the fifth-floor swimming pool for a housewarming event in 2019, the court heard. The bottle hit 73-year-old Nasiari Sunee, and then ricocheted and hit his 69-year-old wife on the shoulder. He died in hospital the next day from his injuries, while his spouse was seriously injured. Gosling, an Australian, pleaded guilty in February to one charge of causing Nasiari's death by a rash act and causing grievous hurt to his wife, Madam Manisah Sitri, also by a rash act. 
His team of lawyers had asked for one to two years' jail and has filed an appeal against the sentence. After throwing the bottle and shouting crude and religiously charged vulgarities, Gosling fled back to his unit, court documents said. It took 10 days for him to confess to the police, after they questioned him thrice and took statements from other condo residents. He has been remanded since surrendering to the authorities. Gosling's charges were reduced from more serious ones of causing grievous hurt to Nasiari with an instrument likely to cause death, as well voluntarily causing hurt to Mdm Manisah in a religiously aggravated act. Psychiatrists found that he was prone to obsessive negative thoughts when intoxicated, which did not represent his true feelings and intentions. OFFENCES WERE RELIGIOUSLY AGGRAVATED In his sentencing remarks on Friday, Principal District Judge Victor Yeo said that Gosling had ""demonstrated clear heedlessness"" and took a ""conscious and deliberate risk"" that the bottle would strike more or one persons, resulting in death or serious injury. The judge agreed with the prosecution that the offences were ""religiously aggravated"" as Gosling had demonstrated religious hostility towards Muslims. ""Such offences could seriously undermine Singapore's racial and religious harmony, and must not be tolerated and must be firmly dealt with. Preserving and building inter-religious harmony in Singapore is sacrosanct and this could have a wider impact of causing unease among the broader Muslim community. ""Hence, a deterrent sentence is necessary to dispel the unease and disquiet that could emanate from the offences,"" District Judge Yeo added. Gosling's actions were also akin to killer litter and such offences ""must be dealt with seriously"" given that a vast majority of Singapore's population resides in high-rise flats, the judge told the court. However, the judge accepted Gosling's lawyers' submissions that he was genuinely remorseful for his offences, despite him only surrendering to the authorities days later. He has voluntarily paid compensation to the family to offset some of their expenses. In terms of the individual sentences, District Judge Yeo chose to run them consecutively instead of concurrently because his offences ""involved a separate and distinct invasion of legally protected interests"". The judge also took into account the ""high degree of rashness"" involved. He sentenced Gosling to four years' jail for causing Nasiari's death and 18 months' jail for seriously injuring Mdm Manisah. The overall sentence was backdated to Aug 28, 2019 when he surrendered to the police. After the court hearing, Mdm Manisah told reporters in Malay that she was thankful her four children were with her and that the family had no comments on the sentence. ""It's fate,"" she added. Her son, Mr Nas Muhammad Nasta'in Nasiari, 41, said that they just wanted closure and to move on from this episode. When asked if they have forgiven Gosling, Mr Nasta'in's brother, who did not want to be named, responded: ""It's hard to forgive. Only time will heal this. We can't forgive him now, it's very difficult."" WHAT HAPPENED The court previously heard that Gosling, who drank two large bottles and a can of beer before hurling the wine bottle, had noticed the group at the barbecue pits on the evening of Aug 18, 2019. He had been in Singapore for a month to find employment in the information technology sector, having lived abroad in places such as Malaysia and Turkey previously. Gosling ascertained that the group was from the Malay-Muslim community since some of the women were wearing headscarves. During investigations, he admitted that upon seeing the group, it crossed his mind to use a weapon like a gun to shoot them. He then dismissed the thought because he thought it was a heinous act. At around 8pm, he left his unit to dispose of rubbish via the common rubbish chute at the lift lobby, which overlooked the barbecue area. Upon finding an empty wine bottle in the rubbish chute, he hurled it towards the group. Prosecutors told the court that there was a distance of about 18m between him and the group at the time. Gosling then ran back to his unit while shouting religiously charged vulgarities. He confessed to throwing the bottle for two reasons: As an act of mischief because he wanted to startle the group when the bottle shattered on the ground, and due to his anger at terrorist acts committed by Islamic fundamentalist groups in Bali, Indonesia and Melbourne, Australia that had claimed the lives of Australians. Nasiari collapsed from being struck by the bottle, which landed on the ground intact. He was taken to Singapore General Hospital in an ambulance, arriving in a completely unresponsive state. A brain scan showed extensive bleeding in his brain, multiple skull fractures and extensive haemorrhaging. He died the morning after the incident when his family declined to resuscitate him. Mdm Manisah suffered extensive bruising over her shoulder among other injuries and her arm was in a sling for two months. WIFE CRIES WHEN ALONE Nasiari and his wife had been married for 45 years. Mdm Manisah took some time to come to terms with her husband's death and experienced flashbacks of the incident, prosecutors told the court. The housewife had been heavily reliant on his salary as a deliveryman. Her four children now give her S$700 a month for household expenses. She also cooks for her children and their families daily, asking them to collect the food so that she would not be alone at home. She feels Nasiari's absence keenly during the fasting month of Ramadan that just began on April 3. Covid-19 restrictions had worsened her loneliness, prosecutors added. Her 17-year-old grandson now stays with her on weeknights to accompany her. Although she tries to stay strong for her children, she would cry to herself when alone, the court heard. Gosling was assessed in the Institute of Mental Health, where psychiatrist Christopher Cheok found that his state of intoxication had impaired his judgement to some extent but it was not enough to remove his culpability for the offence, Dr Cheok added. The psychiatrist's report, which was issued with the defence's psychiatrist Munidasa Winslow, also stated that Gosling's obsessive negative thoughts while intoxicated were likely a product of his impaired mental state and ""not genuinely reflective of an anti-Muslim stance"". ""Even if he had committed the alleged offence, it was unlikely to be religiously motivated,"" the report stated. Those convicted of causing death by a rash act under the Penal Code can be jailed for up to five years or fined, or punished with both. Those who cause grievous hurt by a rash act can be jailed for up to four years or fined up to S$10,000, or both.",Today (Singapore) - Online,8-04-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999984587011043}",en,0.9999984587011043

April 9, 2022 Saturday","As a fibromyalgia patient, I was glad when the Land Transport Authority (LTA) started issuing identification stickers that read ""May I have a seat please'"" to those with invisible medical conditions.
 These stickers were later changed to a more permanent card (above) together with a colourful lanyard, which is definitely an improvement.
 However, whenever I wear this card and sit on a reserved seat, other commuters stare at the card and seem curious about it.
 When I asked my friends, only a few knew about this card.
 Posters with information about the card have been put up at MRT stations and bus interchanges. But as not all commuters pay attention to such posters, especially during peak hours, perhaps stickers with this information could be pasted on the reserved seats on buses and trains, as is already being done with stickers of campaign mascots.
 I also suggest that the appropriate LTA or SMRT logo be placed on the front of the card to make it look more official. The current design may make some people think that we made the card ourselves, or mistake it for a company access pass which many workers wear on public transport.
 When I approached my pain specialist at Singapore General Hospital last year for a referral letter to collect this card, he did not know about this card. Neither did the social worker who attended to me. In fact, they thanked me for highlighting it so that they could pass the information on to other patients who cannot stand for long on public transport.
 I hope more people will become aware of this card so that it can benefit more commuters.
 I am grateful to LTA for coming up with this initiative which helps patients with chronic pain and other medical issues. It has let me be more independent, and allowed me to maintain a social life which greatly enhances my mental health.

185,"Australian jailed for rash act that led to death; He threw bottle that fractured skull of grandfather of nine and injured victim's wife
The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 9, 2022 Saturday","He came to Singapore to look for a job but one month after he arrived here, Australian Andrew Gosling committed a senseless crime which led to the death of a grandfather of nine.
 Yesterday, Gosling, now 49, was sentenced to five years and six months' jail, after he flung a bottle from the seventh storey of a condominium in Spottiswoode Park Road, hitting the head of delivery driver Nasiari Sunee, 73, who later died.
 In what the prosecutors had described as offences that ""demonstrated hostility towards Muslims"" and were ""religiously aggravated"", Gosling flung the bottle towards a group of unsuspecting Malay-Muslims at a barbecue area on the fifth storey.
 It struck the head of Mr Nasiari, fracturing his skull, and he later died in hospital.
 The bottle ricocheted off the elderly man's head and hit the right shoulder of his wife, Madam Manisah Sitri, then 69, whose right arm had to be in a sling for about two months.
 Gosling had pleaded guilty in February this year to committing a rash act that led to Mr Nasiari's death and he also admitted to causing grievous hurt to Madam Manisah.
 In handing down the sentence yesterday, Principal District Judge Victor Yeo agreed with the prosecution that Gosling's acts were religiously aggravated and that the offender had demonstrated religious hostility towards Muslims.
 The judge added: ""Such offences could seriously undermine Singapore's racial and religious harmony, and must not be tolerated and must be firmly dealt with.
 ""Preserving and building inter-religious harmony in Singapore is sacrosanct and this could have a wider impact of causing unease among the broader Muslim community.""
 Deputy Public Prosecutors G. Kannan, Thiagesh Sukumaran and Ben Mathias Tan stated in court documents that Gosling had entered Singapore on July 15, 2019, and rented a unit on the seventh storey of the Spottiswoode 18 condominium the following month.
 On Aug 18 that year, after drinking alcohol, he looked down from his balcony and saw a group of Malay-Muslims having a gathering at the barbecue area two storeys below. Mr Nasiari and his wife were part of the group.
 The prosecutors said that during investigations, Gosling admitted that it had crossed his mind he ""ought to use a weapon, such as a gun"", to shoot at the group of about 15 people.
 But he later dismissed the thought as he felt it would be a ""heinous"" act. Around 8.30pm, Gosling left his unit to throw some rubbish in a common chute at the lift lobby.
 While there, he found an empty wine bottle, which weighed about 600g, and flung it towards the group to ""startle"" them.
 The DPPs also told the court that Gosling committed the act as he was angry and upset at the terrorist attacks committed by Islamic fundamentalist groups in Bali and Melbourne that had killed Australian citizens.
    PRESERVING HARMONY  Such offences could seriously undermine Singapore's racial and religious harmony, and must not be tolerated and must be firmly dealt with. Preserving and building inter-religious harmony in Singapore is sacrosanct and this could have a wider impact of causing unease among the broader Muslim community.
    PRINCIPAL DISTRICT JUDGE VICTOR YEO  The bottle hit the couple, and two ambulances took them to Singapore General Hospital. Gosling surrendered to the police on Aug 28, 2019.
 For causing death by committing a rash act, an offender can be jailed for up to five years and fined.

186,"4-room BTO flats on Keppel Club site could cost over S$700,000, high demand expected: Analysts
Today (Singapore) - Online
April 13, 2022 Wednesday","SINGAPORE - New public flats that will be built on the existing Keppel Club golf site will see very strong demand and could be priced at more than S$700,000 for a four-room flat if they are sold as a regular Built-To-Order (BTO) project, property analysts said. This was why some of them said that these flats should come under the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model to make the units more affordable and also mitigate the ""lottery effect"", which refers to flat owners profiteering from selling the government-subsidised flats. Ms Wong Siew Ying, head of research and content at property firm Propnex Realty, said: ""Given the attractive site attributes, we would consider the future flats on the Keppel Club site to be in the 'limited edition' category. ""As such, we think that the HDB (Housing and Development Board) flats offered should come under the PLH model because of their 'extremely prime location'."" Earlier on Tuesday (April 12), National Development Minister Desmond Lee announced that around 6,000 government-built flats will be constructed on the redeveloped waterfront site of Keppel Club, with the first HDB BTO project at the site to be launched by 2025. The site, located about a 10-minute drive from the Central Business District, is bounded by Telok Blangah Road, Berlayer Creek and Bukit Chermin, and is near the Labrador Park and Telok Blangah MRT stations. 
It is part of the Government's Greater Southern Waterfront project, encompassing a 30km coastline running from Gardens by the Bay to Pasir Panjang The authorities have not said whether the new flats at the Keppel Club site will fall under the prime location model. In response to TODAY's queries, HDB said that it would ""consider a range of factors"" such as the project's attributes and market values before announcing more details when ready. The PLH model was announced in October last year as a means for the Government to allow more than just the wealthy to be able to live in attractive locations while mitigating the so-called ""lottery effect"". This is when people who manage to ballot for and buy a BTO flat in prime locations sell them in the resale market at high prices once they fulfil the minimum occupation period of five years. The PLH model has stricter buying and selling conditions, including limits on rental leases, a longer 10-year minimum occupation period before a flat can be resold and subsidy clawbacks when owners sell their property. Projects in two towns have so far been sold under the PLH model - River Peaks I and II in Rochor and King George's Heights in Kallang-Whampoa. Ms Wong said that the Keppel Club site and all future developments in the high-profile Greater Southern Waterfront development should be sold under the PLH model to offset the lottery effect. ""As Pinnacle@Duxton has shown, prime location flats are very desirable and could fetch high prices - with many flats resold for over S$1 million - on the resale market,"" she added, referring to the BTO project at Tanjong Pagar that was home to the first-ever recorded million-dollar resale transaction for a standard HDB flat. Ms Christine Sun, senior vice-president of research and analytics at property firm Orange Tee and Tie, believes that the authorities may choose to sell some blocks of flats - such as those closer to the MRT stations or facing the waterfront - under the PLH model and others under the regular BTO scheme. This is because of the large number of flats being built on the 48-hectare plot of land, she noted. She added that the Government may also set aside some flats as rental units for lower-income families, community care apartments for seniors and some two-room flexi flats to offer more housing options for Singaporeans. She estimated that a three-room flat sold under the regular BTO scheme will cost around S$400,000 to S$520,000 and for a four-room flat, S$600,000 to S$720,000. For flats sold under the prime location model, a three-room flat may cost S$380,000 to S$480,000 and a four-roomer may cost S$500,000 to S$700,000. With a location so close to offices in Mapletree Business City and One-north, real estate firm Huttons Asia's senior director of research Lee Sze Teck is quite certain that the new flats would be heavily oversubscribed despite the large number of units on offer. He is expecting the three-room flats to be priced at S$400,000 to S$450,000 and four-room flats at S$720,000 to S$850,000 if sold under the regular BTO scheme. If sold under the prime location model, the cost may be between S$360,000 and S$405,000 for a three-room flat and S$650,000 and S$760,000 for a four-room flat. He noted that in a May 2021 BTO launch at a nearby Telok Blangah site, three-room flats went for S$419,000 to S$504,000, while four-room flats were sold for between S$602,000 and S$710,000. The 70 four-room flats, located about 300m from the Keppel Club site, were eventually 44 times oversubscribed, with more than 3,100 applicants. Of the upcoming BTO units at the Keppel Club site, he said: ""This is definitely a prime location and the BTO flats are expected to be heavily oversubscribed. We expect the subscription rate to be more than 10. Five-room flats are unlikely to be offered as the price would be too steep."" Mr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at real estate agency ERA Singapore, is also expecting this BTO launch to be popular, though it would also depend on whether there are other popular projects on offer in the same BTO sales exercise. 3,000 PRIVATE HOMES The analysts noted that during the National Day Rally in 2019, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said then that about 9,000 private and public housing units will be built at the Keppel Club site. This means that the remaining 3,000 units could be set aside for private home sales, which they said would also be highly sought after by buyers and developers. Ms Sun from Orange Tee and Tie said that there are not many new residential sites in Singapore that command sea views and this factor, along with the convenient location, give residential homes in the area good rental potential. PropNex Realty's chief executive officer Ismail Gafoor is of the view that the future private residential projects in this area may be parcelled out and sold via government land sale tenders and eventually launched for sale to buyers in the next three to five years. Taking reference from the latest property launches in the area such as The Reef at King's Dock along Harbourfront Avenue and Avenue South Residence near Singapore General Hospital, he anticipates that the future selling prices of residential projects in the Greater Southern Waterfront may be in the range of S$2,500 to S$2,700 per square foot or higher.",Today (Singapore) - Online,14-04-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999969575964669}",en,0.9999969575964669
187,"Verbal and physical abuse of public workers on the rise; Besides healthcare, other sectors affected include public transport, law enforcement
The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 16, 2022 Saturday","When he spotted an elderly male patient behaving inappropriately towards a female nurse, Mr Lam, a healthcare assistant, rushed over to help his colleague.
 The patient fired a slew of vulgarities at him before punching the 33-year-old in the stomach.
 The elderly man was quickly restrained by other staff.
 Mr Lam, who declined to have his full name published, said he immediately reported the incident to his supervisors, who spoke to the patient.
 They also checked on Mr Lam's well-being.
 He said the incident happened in February at a Covid-19 treatment facility where he still works.
 ""Incidents where we are abused or yelled at by patients are an everyday thing. But sometimes we cannot do much because they may have a mental illness or are old,"" said Mr Lam, who has worked as a healthcare assistant for two years.
 Whether it is a receptionist at a private hospital or a doctor at a public facility, healthcare workers say they have been subjected to verbal, and sometimes physical, abuse.
 Figures released during the debate on the Health Ministry's budget last month showed there were 1,500 cases as at end-2021, up from 1,080 in 2018.
 The Ministry of Health (MOH) recorded 1,300 abuse cases in 2020.
 Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases saw a significant jump in cases - from 158 in 2020 to 284 reported cases last year, a spokesman for TTSH told The Straits Times.
 At Singapore General Hospital, close to 200 abuse cases were reported last year, up from around 170 cases in 2020.
 This trend was mirrored at the National University Hospital, which saw around 100 physical and 160 verbal abuse cases last year, up from 80 physical and 120 verbal abuse cases in 2020.
 Mr Ng Kian Swan, chief operating officer of Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Jurong Community Hospital, said 52 cases of abuse in total were reported by staff at both hospitals last year, up from 36 cases in 2020.
 Meanwhile, Changi General Hospital reported a downward trend - there were about 130 cases of abuse last year, compared with about 200 in 2020.
 But overall, there has been a surge.
 Health Minister Ong Ye Kung drew attention to the issue in a Facebook post on March 25, in which he noted that healthcare workers have been going through a challenging and difficult time amid the pandemic.
 ""On top of taking care of Covid-19 patients and subjecting themselves to risk, they have been doing their very best to ensure all emergency cases are properly attended to,"" said the minister.
 Hospitals told ST some cases may go unreported. This was despite encouraging healthcare workers to report incidents when they occur, they added.
 There appears to be a rise in abuse cases across other sectors as well.
 Responding to queries from ST, a spokesman for the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said while most commuters respect public transport workers, a small number of commuters have been abusive.
 ""When these cases arise, the offenders will be dealt with according to the law,"" he said.
 LTA did not provide figures but in 2020, SBS Transit - the largest scheduled bus operator - said there were nearly 40 cases of assault as at September that year, compared with 33 cases in 2019.
 Even emergency responders have not been spared.
 In February, the Singapore Civil Defence Force said the number of emergency responders harassed last year in the course of their duties was the highest in the past six years. There were 29 verbal and physical harassment cases reported last year, up from 17 cases reported in 2020.
 As for the Singapore Police Force, there were over 400 cases of officers who faced verbal and physical abuse reported over 2019 and 2020.
 Individual workers may not be the target for abusive behaviour, said Dr Annabelle Chow, principal clinical psychologist at Annabelle Psychology.
 ""It could have been pent-up frustration from earlier that day that causes them to lose their cool. The worker then becomes a convenient outlet for them to let off steam,"" she said.
 A spokesman for the Healthcare Services Employees' Union said patients waiting over prolonged periods due to changes in hospital visitation rules during the pandemic may have made it harder for them to cope with their illnesses and loneliness.
 ""Similarly, visitors are affected by the stricter visitor policies as part of safe management measures at hospitals.
 ""At outpatient clinics, longer queues due to higher patient loads could lead to a perceived lack of care and service rendered,"" said the spokesman.
 ""Sometimes, these visitors or patients may vent their frustrations on the healthcare workers verbally or even physically in some cases.""
 Ms Jaya Dass, managing director of Singapore and Malaysia at human resources solutions firm Randstad, said when workers get abused, the job may start to get more stressful and difficult.
 It could lead to some leaving their jobs. The firm provides recruitment services to private and public organisations.
 To offer better protection, more categories of workers were included as public service workers under the Protection from Harassment (Public Service Worker) Order from July 7 last year.
 The law covers sectors such as healthcare, education, transport and security.
 It protects ancillary workers in public healthcare institutions as well, including those who provide administrative, cleaning, operations or security services. Under the law, private-hire drivers are covered too.
 Offenders who harass or abuse a public servant or a public service worker in the course of their work are liable for enhanced penalties, and may be fined up to $5,000, imprisoned for up to 12 months, or both.

188,"Health scare a wake-up call for DJ Divian Nair
The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 22, 2022 Friday","Local radio personality Divian Nair is getting back on his feet after experiencing the worst health scare of his life earlier this month due to a hemiplegic migraine attack.
 Many symptoms of this rare type of migraine mimic those common to stroke, such as muscle weakness that causes a temporary paralysis on one side of the body, as well as ataxia (abnormal, uncoordinated movements) and aphasia (an inability to comprehend or formulate language) which can last for days or weeks.
 On the evening of April 4, the Kiss92 FM DJ was taken by ambulance to Singapore General Hospital when the left side of his face, where he was feeling numbness, began to droop. He assumed he was having a stroke.
 The 35-year-old had woken up from a 15-minute nap feeling giddy, nauseous and weak. He was slurring his speech and his balance was off.
 By the time the paramedics arrived, he was more confused and disorientated - to the point where he could not give his identity card number.
 After two CT scans ruled out a stroke and he was placed in the high-dependency ward, he experienced his worst migraine attack ever - one that lasted 10 hours, was ""10 upon 10 on the pain scale"" and caused him to vomit twice.
 He tells The Straits Times: ""I grew up with migraines and never took anything more than Panadol for it. I've had migraine with aura for the past three years, which occurs every three months, but it wasn't something I saw a doctor for or paid attention to. I just waited for it to go away.""
 Migraine with aura is a recurring headache that strikes after or at the same time as sensory disturbances, which can include flashes of light, blind spots, zigzag lines and other vision changes.
 He was discharged after three days and given 10 days of medical leave as well as strong painkillers.
 During this time, Nair - who had never been hospitalised prior or ""down for so many days before"" - was still slurring and struggling to get his thoughts across.
 He says: ""There were five days when I couldn't speak properly. Up until today, I couldn't say the word 'strange'. I was quite worried (the effects) might be permanent. But the doctors explained that when your brain takes such a big hit, it takes a while for it to readjust and resettle how it routes information.""
 Physically, he was experiencing ""low-battery life"". He could not walk his dog for the whole circuit like he used to and got tired much faster. He also did not have the strength to open a water bottle.
 But he is improving gradually and is now at 90 per cent. He and his social media marketer wife Rachel Chia, 29, who is six months pregnant with their first child, are now on a 10-day holiday in Bangkok.
 The couple had booked the trip a month ago and are taking things slow there.
 Nair expects to return to his weekday morning show, Wake Up And Go With Div & Friends, on Monday with a new lease of life.
 After all, when the doctors told him that hemiplegic migraine - most likely caused by severe stress and fatigue in his case - should not happen to someone his age, it was a wake-up call. ""Large issues at work"", which he declined to elaborate on, have caused him major anxiety for the last few months.
 And after a ""tumultuous"" week, during which he slept only three hours a day, his body told him to stop. He says: ""I also run a video production company and there are multiple shoots, engagements and projects happening. (Minister for Health) Ong Ye Kung also came to do our show. My schedule left me overstretched and it was really the perfect storm.
 ""I had not been very responsible with the way I'd been managing my time. I constantly prioritised fixing issues and problems, and getting something done over rest.""
 After this episode, he is determined to ""re-lay the train tracks because I know that when I start (on something), I won't be looking at where or how fast I'm going"".
 He says: ""I have to actively recalibrate my priorities, so that when I turn on the machine again, at least I know that this is planned to be sustainable. It wasn't before, it was 'try to do as much as I can with however much time I have'.""
 He is also looking forward to taking the Kiss92 FM morning show to new heights on his own - after his on-air partner, local actress Jo Tan, left early last month.
 Instead of relying on the banter among a bevy of brand-name DJs, it has been reangled to a community-based, family-focused programme featuring a variety of voices from guests, friends and even kids.
 And the new format appears to be paying off.
 Nair, who is happy to have more leeway and autonomy, says: ""We achieved quite a lot of success so far. From my experience on radio for 12 years, in that one month, we saw the most number of new and dormant listeners contribute and participate.""
 He adds: ""I don't think of myself as a celebrity. That's not my game. I'm just a conduit for the voices. My job is only to make sure Singaporeans are talking to other Singaporeans on the show.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),21-04-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999956662775693}",en,0.9999956662775693
189,"Singapore cannot let valuable lessons from COVID-19, 'for which we have paid dearly', go to waste: PM Lee
Channel NewsAsia
April 24, 2022 Sunday 7:10 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: The COVID-19 pandemic has taught Singapore valuable lessons ""for which we have paid dearly"" and they must not go to waste, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Apr 24).
Speaking at an event to mark 200 years since the establishment of Singapore General Hospital (SGH) in 1821, Mr Lee said Singapore ""cannot thoughtlessly revert to the status quo ante"" after the pandemic.
""We must make the most of the changes forced on us by the crisis to improve the way we do things,"" said the Prime Minister.
Mr Lee credited Singapore's resilient healthcare system, an effective public health response and a high degree of public trust with making ""a big difference"" in weathering the pandemic.
But ""while we count our blessings, we must prepare seriously for the next pandemic"", said Mr Lee.
""It is entirely possible that within the next few decades, another novel pathogen more lethal and infectious than COVID-19 will sweep the world,"" he said.
This means Singapore must keep its standards for medical excellence high, by investing in healthcare workers and good medical facilities and infrastructure, Mr Lee said.
The country must also build up its scientific and biomedical capabilities to take advantage of the R&D expertise it has built up over the years, he added.
Singapore will also turn to developing public health expertise, which he described as ""absolutely critical"" in a pandemic.
""We need to be able to understand how a new disease is spreading, make sense of disease trends ... and devise non-medical measures that can help bring the outbreak under control in our population,"" he said.
The Government will also shift its focus from hospital-centric care to patient-centred, preventive care by ""tackling illness at its root, before it progresses to the point of needing treatment"", Mr Lee said.
This will address the pressing needs of the ageing population and the burden of chronic diseases on the healthcare system, Mr Lee explained.
ROLE OF TRUST
However, the most critical factor in Singapore's pandemic response, Mr Lee said, is trust. This high degree of trust - between Singaporeans and the Government, and in one another - has been built up over the years, he said.
""It is the fundamental reason why Singaporeans were able to come together during the pandemic, instead of working against each other,"" he said, pointing to how the population abided by ""burdensome"" safe management measures and went for vaccinations and booster jabs.
Public trust in the healthcare system is based on the competency and commitment of healthcare workers, said Mr Lee.
The transparency of the healthcare system, even when things fail to go as planned, has also played a part, he added.
He cited the example of the Ministry of Health regularly reporting statistics on serious adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination and proactively investigating any errors, such as when someone received the wrong dose.
""Some may be tempted to think that it would have been easier to keep things quiet ... but it would have been very unwise,"" said the Prime Minister. ""Rumours will spread, people will gradually lose faith in the system and we will eventually pay a high price - the loss of public trust"". An effective public health response also helped Singapore deal with the COVID-19 crisis, Mr Lee said.
This refers to the use of public policies, including non-medical interventions, to manage the course of the pandemic and limit the spread of the virus.
Examples of such measures include isolating, contact tracing, safe management measures and cross-border restrictions.
Singapore's national vaccination programme also required many public health decisions, Mr Lee noted.
For example, decisions were made about which groups to vaccinate first, how soon to administer booster shots, and how to differentiate between the vaccinated and unvaccinated.
""Effectively integrating these public health tools and considerations with our resilient healthcare system made all the difference in this pandemic,"" said Mr Lee.
Mr Lee also credited Singapore's ""strong and resilient"" healthcare system with helping the country weather COVID-19.
Describing how Singapore has invested heavily in healthcare infrastructure, Mr Lee pointed to the construction and expansion of eight public acute and community hospitals since 2010. The number of polyclinics has also increased from 18 to 23 in the past five years.
When COVID-19 hit Singapore, hospitals built up stockpiles of essential medical supplies, ramped up intensive care unit (ICU) capacity and reorganised and mobilised resources to support the emergency departments and COVID-19 wards, Mr Lee noted.
""LUCKY BREAKS""
While the three factors - public trust, an effective health public health response and a strong healthcare system - were key for Singapore during the pandemic, there were some more fortuitous factors - ""lucky breaks,"" Mr Lee acknowledged.
COVID-19, unlike the Spanish flu, has been less lethal for young and healthy people, and this helped to mitigate the outbreak in Singapore's migrant worker dormitories, said Mr Lee.
In addition, the emergence of ""super-transmissible"" variants like Delta and Omicron only came about a year or two into the pandemic, Mr Lee noted, and this meant countries were able to limit the damage, albeit after learning painful lessons.
And the ""final piece of good fortune"" was the availability of highly effective mRNA vaccines within a year.
This was the ""result of sustained advances in biotechnology over decades, and the collective efforts of governments, international institutions, pharmaceutical firms, and universities"", said Mr Lee.
""So while we count our blessings, we must prepare seriously for the next pandemic, lest we are not as lucky next time."" ""CITY COMING BACK TO LIFE""
Singapore is approaching its goal of living with COVID-19, Mr Lee said, in a speech that came two days after Singapore announced major steps to roll back COVID-19 restrictions.
""You can feel the city coming back to life,"" he said. ""We are quietly confident of dealing with whatever may come, and continuing to progress towards the new normal.""
But even during the pandemic, Singapore was able to maintain a ""degree of normalcy"", said Mr Lee as he highlighted the role of one group of people.
""Our healthcare workers displayed professionalism and commitment, kept our healthcare system strong and resilient, and enabled Singapore to maintain a degree of normalcy in extraordinary times,"" he added, thanking healthcare workers for their ""courage, perseverance, and commitment to the cause"".
""Singapore is deeply grateful to all of you,"" said Mr Lee. INITIAL: vc(ac)",Channel NewsAsia,25-04-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.999996919508609}",en,0.999996919508609

April 24, 2022 Sunday","A fish bone was the reason Mr Ng Yi-Xian left his well-paying job in the United States to return home to help his mother run the EtonHouse group of schools.
 He was back in Singapore over Christmas 2013 when his mum, Mrs Ng Gim Choo, swallowed a fish bone. He had to rush her to the emergency department of Singapore General Hospital to get it dislodged. It pained him to see her looking so vulnerable.
 ""That experience made me realise, A, that I want to come back home, and, B, if something happens to my mother, what happens to the entire company'"" he says.
 This is a story Mr Ng has told many times at interviews, and he relates it with practised ease.
 What happens next is more unexpected.
 Mrs Ng, who is seated next to him, leans over, smacks him on the knee and retorts with a hearty laugh: ""I should have swallowed a fish bone a lot earlier.""
 He smiles sheepishly at this.
 I'm meeting the mother and son at The Gong at Duo Galleria, a restaurant next to Bugis MRT station.
 Mrs Ng is founder, chairwoman and group managing director of the EtonHouse International Education Group.
 Trim and sporting a flattering shoulder-length hairstyle, she cuts a striking figure and looks much younger than her 69 years in a pink Shanghai Tang cheongsam and Ferragamo heels.
 Her make-up is flawlessly applied, her nails are painted a peachy shade, and she is wearing matching pearl-diamond earrings, brooch and ring.
 Behind this tai tai facade is an astute businesswoman who grew one pre-school in 1995 to a network of 120 schools across 11 countries.
 She strikes me as someone who doesn't mince her words, and her son confirms as much.
 ""A lot of people are in awe of my mother, myself included,"" he says.
 ""I don't know what my mum is going to say next, which is always interesting in a meeting. Sometimes, people don't like it because if you don't know what your boss is going to say, there's this uncertainty. But I think that's what makes the group continuously evolve.""
 On Jan 1 this year, Mr Ng - the youngest of three children - was promoted to group CEO.
 He opted to keep his executive director title as well, for sentimental reasons.
 ""It's a position that my mother and uncle held before me years before, so it's always been close to my heart,"" he explains.
 Like his mother, the 37-year-old is stylishly turned out, in a blue checked shirt, blue jacket and brown trousers. He's earnest and amiable, with a ready smile.
 Their connection over lunch is warm. She looks at him with pride, lets him do most of the talking - ""you say"", she tells him several times - and he listens respectfully when she speaks.
 ""My mum and I have a very good relationship,"" he says at one point.
 ""So far, so good,"" she notes more matter-of-factly, when describing their relationship at work. ""Very blessed.""
  EARLY YEARS There is a backstory to their choice of restaurant for our lunch.
 Years ago, Mrs Ng was in Xi'an in China when she came down with mycoplasma, a bacterial infection, and had to be hospitalised.
 Ms Amanda See, a Singaporean who was based in the Chinese city and whose daughter was studying at an EtonHouse school there, visited Mrs Ng with Starbucks coffee and chicken soup.
 Inspired by how Mrs Ng had built up EtonHouse, Ms See decided to go into business when her family returned to Singapore. She now has four restaurants.
 ""How nice to make a friend when you are away,"" says Mrs Ng. ""So I thought it's meaningful to have lunch here - a lady who looked after me when I was not well, and she said I inspired her, so we support her.""
 Ms See suggests we get a mixed meat platter, salt and pepper squid, a salmon salad - Mrs Ng's favourite - and Hokkien mee.
 It's easy to see why she was inspired by Mrs Ng's story, for it is a business study in good timing and seizing opportunities.
 In 1982, Mrs Ng gave up her job as an accountant at Ernst & Young to go with her husband to London for a job posting.
 Mr Ng Hark Seng was then a regional controller in Rank Xerox. They had two children - daughter E-Ching was four and son Yi-Sheng was two.
 Mrs Ng was surprised by how much her daughter enjoyed going to her pre-school in London, which stressed learning through play.
 Four years later, her husband was posted to Hong Kong as the chief financial officer in a listed company. By then, they had a third child, Yi-Xian.
 The older children attended a primary school in the city that followed the English school system.
 Back in Singapore after her husband's postings, she toyed with the idea of starting a pre-school where learning was fun and joyful.
 In 1995, she opened her first pre-school with $500,000 in seed capital from her husband and other investors.
 Her timing was good because Singapore's declining birth rate meant the closure of primary schools, and sites were being tendered out.
 Her elder brother, Mr Jimmy Oh, urged her to bid for a site in Broadrick Road in Mountbatten. He became a business partner.
 She named it EtonHouse after the elite boarding school in Britain, and hired teachers from Britain. She took pre-school training courses herself and went on to get a master's in educational management from The University of Western Australia.
 In the first year, the business lost $1 million, but it quickly found a niche among families willing to spend top dollar on their children.
 In 1998, EtonHouse started a primary school for children of expatriates. Five years later, a school in Suzhou in China was up and running.
 There are now 20,000 students in the 120 schools, which include 40 in Singapore, 50 in China, and others in Indonesia, Japan and even Kazakhstan.
 The group has several brands for children from two months to 18 years old. Its infant care and pre-schools attract expatriate and local families, and its international schools cater to expatriates.
 There is EtonHouse, where full-day childcare averages $1,900 a month, pre-school $2,500 and primary to high school $2,600.
 In 2014, the E-Bridge brand of pre-schools was launched in Singapore's heartland, with fees capped at $720 a month. This is run by Mrs Ng's husband, who joined the company in 2004.
 The Middleton brand was started in 2017 as a more affordable international school with monthly fees of about $1,500.
 There are also the Hampton pre-schools in Tanjong Pagar and Bishan, and The Eton Academy, which offers enrichment classes.
 Mrs Ng owns 100 per cent of the business as her brother retired last year and sold his shares to her. He is now adviser to the group.
 She says her husband has been happy to let her run and front the business.
 ""As a professional, he had a comfortable income so I could afford to take risks,"" she says of the early years. When the business lost money in its first year, he told her ""never mind, focus on quality"".
 She adds how a fortune teller had advised him not to run a business as he wouldn't do well.
 Her brother was involved because ""blood is thicker, very thick"".
 While he was in charge of matters like acquiring sites, she worked on the pedagogical aspects of the business. Both her brother and her husband have been good mentors, she adds.
 Her nickname is Chief Emotional Officer for her ability to get along with family, says her son.
 Using what he says is a ""pre-school teacher's vernacular"", he adds that adults also have their ""red zones"", when they feel like they're losing it.
 ""Maybe it's because my mum is a trained pre-school teacher that she understands that in each of us,"" he says.
  MY MUM, MY BOSS After the fish bone incident, Mr Ng went back to Boston, where he was a hedge fund analyst, and gave his boss six months' notice.
 He then fulfilled a dream to travel around the world, and was planning to do it for a year before he joined EtonHouse.
 ""I travelled for 11 months and it was really good. I remember I told my mum, 'I still have to do Asia.'""
 Her reply: ""You don't need to do Asia. We have business in Asia.""
 He was needed in the company, which was expanding, including in China.
 They had a ""gentleman's agreement"" that he would quit if things didn't work out, says Mrs Ng.
 He recalls giving her a birthday card. ""I wrote, 'Dear Mum, I love you, happy birthday. If you want to be just Mum and not my boss, it's okay, just let me know, but...'""
 She interrupts him and finishes the story: ""'...if you find me not suitable, it's okay, I can leave, and I'll have 100 per cent of you as my mum. Right now, I only have about 25 per cent of you.'""
 It was important to get ""young blood"" in, she says. ""All the parents of the children in our schools are 30-plus to 40 years old, so if you ask a 70-year-old to make decisions on the children, I would worry about how relevant the decisions are.""
 Mr Ng, who is married to a pilates instructor and wellness consultant, has two-year-old twin boys.
 At work, he calls his mother ""Mum"".
 ""It's actually a faux pas because I think in most family businesses, you'd say ""Mrs Ng"" at work. But I couldn't bear to do that, I don't know why.""
 She doesn't mind. ""It's the respect that is important,"" she pronounces.
 Work disputes between them are sorted out very civilly. ""If I make a mistake, I'll tell him, 'Yes, I'm wrong.' If he makes a mistake, he says, 'Yes, you're right',"" says the mum.
 During the first three months after he joined EtonHouse, they had a major disagreement. He would reveal only that it had to do with school fees and how he wanted to give people ""more of a pathway"".
 ""But the reality is that it's something that is very hard to commit to very early on because you don't know what unforeseen things can happen to you,"" he says of the lesson he learnt from her.
  ALL IN THE FAMILY Mrs Ng is no stranger to family businesses. Her paternal grandparents set up the Oh Guan Hing sesame oil factory more than 100 years ago. It is still in operation and run by family members, including the fourth generation.
 She grew up as the fourth of six children and is the only one among her sisters and female cousins to go to university.
 She studied at Chinese-language schools - Sin Ming Public School, Thomson Secondary School and Thomson High School - until she went to the University of Singapore to study accountancy and had to struggle to learn English.
 Her daughter E-Ching, 43, has a PhD in linguistics from Yale University and was a lecturer at the National University of Singapore. First son Yi-Sheng, 41, is a well-known writer and playwright with a PhD in English from Nanyang Technological University.
 Mr Ng says he was the least academically inclined of the three.
 After Nanyang Primary School, he went to Outram Secondary School. ""My PSLE score was 215,"" he says. ""It was very humbling.""
 But he is grateful to have had the chance to see ""different kinds of people and... how different people live"".
 He went on to Anglo-Chinese Junior College and the University of Virginia in the US where he did commerce, and worked at Credit Suisse before he joined a hedge fund.
 His mother praises his ability to get along with different types of people, and for being sensible and savvy.
 When he was four, he was playing with his brother when a car came their way. ""Straightaway he went and pushed his brother out of the way. He said, 'A car is coming, dangerous,'"" she says, demonstrating how he shoved his brother to safety.
 In 2020 after the twins came, Mr Ng and his family moved out of the family home in the Bukit Timah area into a condominium nearby. They see one another at work and have been kept busy as a third Middleton campus is opening soon.
 EtonHouse has an annual revenue of about $200 million and I wonder how profitable the business is.
 ""It's sustainable,"" says Mrs Ng.
 ""We're doing okay,"" says the son, who adds that margins for education are not nearly as good as one might think. ""People often think a high-priced service equals high profits. But you have to remember that our teacher-child ratio is very rich.""
 Private equity firms have come a-courting but they intend to keep the business family-owned for the time being. While the other two children do not have any role in EtonHouse, Mrs Ng doesn't rule that out in future.
 Before they head back to their office in Stevens Road, Mr Ng mentions that they are part of an organisation called Family Business Network.
 ""One line I heard that stuck out for my mum and me was 'family-owned businesses, we look out for generations, we don't look out for quarters',"" he says.
 It might have taken a fish bone to nudge him to join his mum, but he admits: ""I think deep down inside, I felt that it was in a way my fate.""

191,"Prime Minister pays tribute to 'fearless' healthcare workers battling pandemic
The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 25, 2022 Monday","The professionalism and commitment of healthcare workers in Singapore was a key reason that the country retained a degree of normalcy during the two extraordinary Covid-19 years, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday.
 Speaking at the Singapore General Hospital's Lecture and Formal Dinner 2022, PM Lee paid tribute to the more than 62,000 healthcare workers who bore the brunt of the pandemic.
 This comes as the Republic lifts most of its Covid-19 restrictions and transitions to living with the coronavirus, with the relaxed measures taking effect tomorrow.
 ""They were stretched to the limit but maintained the highest standards,"" PM Lee said at the event held at Shangri-La Singapore. ""They were constantly on the front lines, determined and resilient, even at the start when we understood little of the virus.""
 He added that doctors, nurses and other volunteers were ""fearless"" in executing their duties in the early days of the pandemic when outbreaks occurred in many migrant worker dormitories.
 Healthcare workers were also among the first to brook the wearing of full personal protective equipment for entire days and among the last to cease rostered routine Covid-19 testing.
 ""These two years have been challenging for them, and such a pace is clearly unsustainable in normal times. So we must continue our efforts across the board - at the institutions, clusters, ministry and also in the community - to prevent fatigue and burnout among our healthcare workers,"" PM Lee said.
 In the past two years, many healthcare workers were unable to take leave and worked long hours every day, often redeployed at short notice to new roles.
 Studies of healthcare workers showed signs of increased burnout and psychological distress. Resignation rates went up, with 1,500 people quitting in the first half of last year compared with a pre-pandemic annual average of 2,000.
 With the coronavirus now abating, staff have begun to be rostered for leave.
 PM Lee said the authorities have done their best to give healthcare workers some respite and breaks from their duties to recover and recharge. He added: ""We must take good care of their welfare and well-being, if we expect them to continue doing their best for all of us.""

192,"Shifting focus to preventive care is difficult but right thing to do: PM Lee
The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 25, 2022 Monday","Shifting the healthcare system's focus from the reactive treatment of diseases when they surface to a more preventive one that relies on regular screenings will be a huge challenge but is the right direction to take, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday.
 ""It will demand considerable commitment and effort from many stakeholders - not just from the Government,"" he said at the Singapore General Hospital's Lecture and Formal Dinner 2022, held at Shangri-La Singapore.
 ""It calls for a mindset shift and a fundamental reorientation of how our whole system works,"" he added.
 As Singapore assesses its healthcare system post-Covid-19, the Government has said that it wants everyone to enrol with a family physician from next year, so that each person has a doctor who is familiar with his healthcare risk factors.
 This will nip illnesses in the bud and keep more people healthy and out of the hospital, which is particularly important as Singapore confronts issues related to an ageing population and possibly more suffering from chronic illnesses.
 PM Lee said it will lighten the burden on hospitals, making healthcare expenditure more sustainable, adding that it is ""clearly the right strategic direction to take"".
 ""(It) will shift decisively from hospital-centric care to a patient-centred preventive care,"" he said.
 ""Focus on healthcare outcomes, starting early while the person is still healthy and tackling illness at its root, before it progresses to the point of needing treatment.""
 The Ministry of Health (MOH) is due to release in the second half of the year a White Paper on what has been called the Healthier SG initiative.
 The broad-based strategy shift was announced earlier this year during the Budget debate, with MOH saying that Singapore needed to turn its attention to a far more challenging pandemic of longer-term, chronic illnesses.
 One of these is diabetes.
 Singapore leads the world in diabetes-induced kidney failure, with 5.7 new patients diagnosed with the condition daily and more than 8,500 dialysis patients here.
 A greater focus on preventive care would enable hospitals here to focus on complex conditions and emergency cases, while reducing healthcare expenditure, which is expected to triple in the coming decade to almost $27 billion in 2030, MOH said.

193,"'I didn't want any of my guys to die': Book chronicles stories of SGH staff
The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 25, 2022 Monday","When he was first told to prepare for a new virus from Wuhan in early 2020, Associate Professor Kenneth Tan, then newly minted head of Singapore General Hospital's (SGH) Department of Emergency Medicine, felt a mixture of excitement and pride.
 ""We were finally going to show the world what our Emergency Department was all about. I was going to be the head of department during this pandemic and the ED would do very well,"" said Prof Tan.
 But the new coronavirus, or Sars-CoV-2, as it later came to be known, did not turn out the way many believed it would - and neither did the situation on the ground.
 ""We didn't anticipate that the number of tourists who would come in from China to our department would be tremendous, and it overwhelmed our facilities,"" he told The Straits Times.
 The situation rapidly worsened. More and more people turned up, and staff struggled to manage the situation even as their colleagues who treated Singapore's first patient at the hospital began to come down with fever and other symptoms.
 ""It really was very heartbreaking,"" said Prof Tan last Friday, recounting the case of a young, newly married doctor who had a high fever after seeing the first patient. His is just one of many stories told in Purpose With Passion: Our Covid-19 Stories, a book chronicling the experiences and perspectives of SGH's healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic.
 The 10-chapter book was launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday at SGH's Lecture and Formal Dinner 2022, held at Shangri-La Singapore.
 In the book, Prof Tan recounted: ""I called (the young doctor) and he told me, 'I am very scared. I can't see my family. I can't see my wife, I don't know what's going on.'
 ""I didn't want any of my guys to die, I wanted them to be safe. There was this dread of losing someone on my watch. If they died, how would I face their family'""
 SGH chief executive Kenneth Kwek wrote in the book's foreword: ""The many first-hand accounts in this book speak to our humanity - our fears and anxieties, our despair when it seemed there was no end in sight, as well as the symbiosis of our actions.""
 The book was put together by an editorial committee led by Professor Tan Ban Hock, senior consultant in SGH's Department of Infectious Diseases, who was also the book's chief editor.
 In another account in the book, Associate Professor Phua Ghee Chee, a senior consultant in the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, which he headed till April 1, shared the important roles that both veteran and junior healthcare staff played during the crisis.
 ""We were never short of volunteers for the isolation wards. It was heartening that the newer generation of clinicians were as dedicated, committed and courageous as their seniors were. I am really proud of the new generation of healthcare workers. The future shines bright,"" he said.
 Prof Tan said: ""I think the book is going to be a very important piece of history for SGH, also about what Singapore went through, to share with future generations.
 ""I think it's important that the book captures... all these emotions and thoughts and processes, which can be shared with the next generation when they have to tackle the next disease.""

194,"Singapore must not let valuable lessons from Covid-19 go to waste: PM; S'pore will one day face Disease X, and must be ready to mount an effective response, he says
The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 25, 2022 Monday","Singapore should make the most of the changes forced on it by Covid-19 to improve the way it does things, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday.
 Speaking at the Singapore General Hospital's (SGH) Lecture and Formal Dinner 2022, which was held at Shangri-La Singapore, PM Lee noted that Singapore will one day encounter Disease X.
 This is the name given to a new pathogen that might emerge in the future, one that is highly transmissible, highly lethal, and mutates easily.
 PM Lee said: ""With Covid-19, countries already struggled to cope, and humankind paid a heavy price in suffering and death.
 ""It is entirely possible that within the next few decades, another novel pathogen more lethal and infectious than Covid-19 will sweep the world... We must prepare for it early, the best we can, so as to be ready to mount a swift and effective response when it happens.""
 Shifting away from future pandemics, PM Lee added: ""We cannot thoughtlessly revert to the status quo ante after this crisis. Or let valuable lessons, for which we have paid dearly, go to waste.""
 He said that this means two things for the nation's healthcare system.
 First, it must keep up its high standards of medical excellence by continually investing in its healthcare workers, and supporting them with good medical facilities and healthcare infrastructure.
 At the same time, this also means building up Singapore's scientific and biomedical capabilities, and collaborating with researchers in other countries.
 Second, there is a need to further develop an emphasis on public health.
 Public health focuses on the health of the overall population and not of individuals. The priority is to benefit as many people as possible, PM Lee said.
 That is why Singapore replaced the more sensitive polymerase chain reaction tests with the antigen rapid tests for most cases, so as to pick up and isolate infectious cases faster and more cheaply.
 This made a bigger impact on disease transmission, he added.
 Noting that in normal times, many other ""popular"" medical specialisations are more sought after, PM Lee pointed out that in a pandemic, public health expertise is crucial.
 This is because the nation must be able to understand how a new disease is spreading, make sense of disease trends, and devise models to assess and predict them, evaluate alternative public health measures, and devise non-medical interventions that can help bring the outbreak under control.
 So there is a need to strengthen skills in these areas, and ensure high-quality public health inputs inform policymaking, said PM Lee.
 He added: ""Singapore must continue to grow in maturity and resilience, learning from our experiences and those of others, and so must our healthcare system.""
 During his speech, PM Lee also noted the remarkable transformations SGH has undergone over the years.
 ""SGH's success mirrors our journey as a nation, and the tremendous improvement in our healthcare standards,"" he said, noting that today, Singapore has one of the highest life expectancies and lowest infant mortality rates in the world.
 PM Lee said Singapore and its healthcare system must continue growing in maturity and resilience, and learning from its experiences and those of others.
 ""I trust that SGH will continue to contribute your talent and leadership to this endeavour, and in so doing help to achieve good healthcare outcomes for Singapore for many years to come.""
    '' PM Lee on...CONTINUING TO NURTURE A DEEP RESERVOIR OF TRUST  Even when the going gets tough, and especially when the going gets tough, we must continue to live by these cardinal values, and continue to strengthen the trust that we depend on to stay together and pull through.

195,"Trust is 'most precious resource' in Singapore's Covid-19 fight: PM Lee; Country must strengthen public health and not 'thoughtlessly' revert to old mode, he says
The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 25, 2022 Monday","Trust has probably been the most critical factor in Singapore's pandemic response - and the nation must learn from Covid-19 and not let lessons from it go to waste, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday.
 These include upholding Singapore's standards of medical excellence and further developing its expertise in public health.
 He was speaking at the Singapore General Hospital's (SGH) Lecture and Formal Dinner 2022, which was held at Shangri-La Singapore.
 Addressing about 300 guests on site, as well as about another 1,000 gathered online, PM Lee cited a study in The Lancet which found that higher levels of trust in the government and among the population were associated with greater compliance with Covid-19 restrictions and higher vaccination rates.
 ""In fact, by this measure, trust levels mattered much more even than the quality of healthcare and access to universal healthcare.
 ""I do not believe this means a good healthcare system makes no difference - it is absolutely necessary. But it does show how crucial trust levels in the society are to public health and healthcare outcomes,"" he said, adding that Singapore is fortunate to be a high-trust society.
 He said strong public trust has been built up over the decades between Singaporeans and the Government.
 This involves trust that the Government has the best interest of Singapore and Singaporeans at heart, that the Government is competent and will make the right decisions on behalf of Singaporeans, and that every citizen will play his or her part.
 ""This trust is a most precious resource. It is the fundamental reason why Singaporeans were able to come together during the pandemic, instead of working against each other,"" said PM Lee.
 He cited four examples of this: People here abiding by ""burdensome"" safe management measures, patiently enduring repeated rounds of easing and tightening, going for vaccinations and booster jabs, and exercising personal and social responsibility.
 ""In other countries, a precaution as simple and essential as wearing a mask became a heated point of contention between citizens... Fortunately, in Singapore the opposite happened,"" he noted.
 PM Lee said that a big part of this was due to the public's trust in the healthcare system here, which in turn was based on three things.
 First, trust that healthcare workers here are professional, and know their job well.
 Second, that they are dedicated and selfless, committed to the care, treatment and well-being of their patients.
 Public health, he pointed out, focuses on the health of the overall population and not of individuals. The priority is to benefit as many people as possible.
 That is why, even though the polymerase chain reaction tests are more sensitive, Singapore replaced them with the antigen rapid tests for most cases, to pick up and isolate infectious cases faster and more cheaply. This made a bigger impact on disease transmission.
 Third, that the healthcare system is open and honest with the public.
 For instance, said PM Lee, during the vaccination campaign, the Health Ministry regularly reported statistics on serious adverse events.
 He said: ""Some may be tempted to think that it would have been easier to keep things quiet, and avoid causing unnecessary alarm with bad news. It would have been expedient and convenient, but it would have been very unwise.
 ""If we kept quiet, it might work once, or twice. But rumours will spread, people will gradually lose faith in the system, and we will eventually pay a high price - the loss of public trust.""
 He noted that taking responsibility for mistakes and striving to put things right is essential to strengthening public trust, especially during crises when stakes are high.
 PM Lee said there is a need to continue nurturing trust in the healthcare system during normal times, by always maintaining high standards of competency, commitment and transparency in the system.
 In the next crisis, there will then be a ""deep reservoir of trust"" that can be drawn upon, he added.
 ""And, of course, even when the going gets tough, and especially when the going gets tough, we must continue to live by these cardinal values,"" he said.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 27, 2022 Wednesday","An 86-year-old woman left behind in a burning house in Yio Chu Kang was rescued by police officers, two of whom braved the thick smoke to reach her.
 Sergeant Choong K-Ron, a 21-year-old full-time national serviceman, had come up with the idea of crawling on the ground through the smoke to reach the grandmother.
 The trio from the Serangoon Neighbourhood Police Centre were on patrol nearby on April 16 when they were dispatched to the scene. They were the first ones there at around 6.10pm, said Sergeant Tan Wei Jie, 27, during an interview on Monday.
 The house was engulfed in thick black smoke and family members who had evacuated shouted to the officers that their grandmother was stuck on the second floor, he said.
 Sgt Tan and Sgt Choong hurried into the burning house, while another NSF - Special Constable (SC) Muhammad Amru Abd Rahman, 21 - managed the crowd outside.
 ""There wasn't much time to think, it was instinct,"" said Sgt Tan. ""When we made it up to the second floor, it was close to pitch black even with a torch.
 ""After a few seconds, we had difficulty breathing and felt some pain in the lungs. Imagine how much worse it was for someone more senior.""
 Unable to breathe, the pair retreated to the stairs. Then Sgt Choong suggested they crawl through the smoke, recalling fire safety tips he had learnt in the past.
 They shuffled on all fours through the smoke, yelling for the elderly woman.
 Said Sgt Tan: ""We saw her feet below the smoke, staggering towards us. We quickly stood up and grabbed her from the side and supported her as she headed down to the ground floor.""
 He estimated the rescue took a few minutes, and added: ""She didn't say much... She looked quite confused but relieved that she was taken to safety.""
 Their faces blackened with soot, the officers handed the grandmother to the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) paramedics, who had arrived.
 An SCDF spokesman said it was alerted to the fire at 6.05pm.
 The blaze involved the contents of a bedroom on the second floor and SCDF personnel put out the fire using a water jet and compressed air foam, he added.
 One person suffered smoke inhalation injuries and was taken to Singapore General Hospital, said the spokesman, adding that the cause of the fire was being investigated. It is understood that the grandmother is well.
 Sgt Choong, who will complete his full-time national service next month, said there was no time to speak to the elderly woman or her family during the incident as they needed to evacuate the residents in the nearby homes.
 The incident marked an eventful first patrol for SC Amru, who completed eight months of police training this month.

198,"Realign the joint and save the knee; Knee preservation surgery could help people delay or avoid knee replacements, say experts
The Straits Times (Singapore)
April 27, 2022 Wednesday","Mr Segar Sivanasen hurt his knee while playing football in January 2019 and could not walk, squat or sleep comfortably for months because of worsening pain.
 The 44-year-old founder of a logistics company suffered severe discomfort as a result of knee osteoarthritis, or damage to the cartilage tissue which cushions the bones in the knee.
 Advanced cases of knee osteoarthritis can be treated by knee replacement surgery, where the knee joint is replaced by a metal or plastic implant that can last 20 to 25 years.
 But Mr Segar's doctor recommended a high tibial osteotomy, a surgery that realigned the knee joint and took the pressure off the damaged part of the knee.
 Such surgery which preserves the knee could reduce the need for future knee replacement, and keep younger people mobile and pain-free for longer, experts say.
 Mr Segar had the surgery in August 2019 and, within two months, was able to walk on crutches. ""The nagging pain was no longer there,"" says the father of two, who has given up football and now swims and goes for brisk walks instead.
 A key consideration when opting for the osteotomy was the risk of having to go under the knife again in his late 50s or 60s, if the knee replacement implant wore out.
 The lifespan of a knee replacement is a reason that knee preservation surgical procedures, which include osteotomies, might be recommended for patients who are below 60 with moderate knee osteoarthritis.
 Addressing knee osteoarthritis is a key concern for Singapore's ageing population, say experts.
 The associated pain and stiffness affect quality of life and health. At least 10 per cent of the population suffers from knee osteoarthritis and this is set to rise as people live longer and exercise later into life.
  KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS EXPLAINED Knee osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease and the most common type of arthritis in the knee, says Dr Wang Lushun, consultant and head of division at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital's division of hip and knee surgery, department of orthopaedic surgery.
 Other types of arthritis affecting the knee include rheumatoid arthritis and gout, which are both inflammatory conditions.
    The nagging pain was no longer there.
     MR SEGAR SIVANASEN after undergoing a high tibial osteotomy in August 2019 to realign the knee joint and take the pressure off the damaged part of the knee. The 44-year-old injured his knee while playing football in January that year  He says: ""Knee osteoarthritis is an age-related 'wear and tear' type of arthritis. The cartilage that cushions the bones of the knee softens and wears away. The bones come closer together, reducing joint space, and form bone spurs. This causes knee deformity, pain and stiffness. It is one of the leading causes of disability in the elderly.""
 Dr Wang says that in Singapore, the prevalence of knee osteoarthritis increases sharply after 40 years of age, and affects up to twice as many women as men.
 Professor James Hui, head and senior consultant at the National University Hospital's department of orthopaedic surgery, says knee osteoarthritis can result in changes to the shape of the joint and affects how people move and walk.
 ""These changes usually develop slowly and get worse over time. Knee osteoarthritis can cause pain, stiffness and swelling. In some cases, it may also cause reduced function and disability. As a result, some people are no longer able to do daily tasks or work.""
 Injuries such as the fall suffered by Mr Segar can also cause knee osteoarthritis and affect mobility.
 Experts say that in the long-term, this lack of mobility could increase patients' risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.
 Treatments for pain caused by knee osteoarthritis include physiotherapy; modifying one's activity to reduce stress on the knee joint; and getting orthotic support.
 But if these fail, surgical procedures could be done to ease pain and improve the patient's mobility.
 Knee preservation surgery includes knee arthroscopic procedures, which are operations to treat damage to the cartilage, meniscus or ligaments.
 In contrast, knee osteotomies cut the bones to correct the alignment of a patient's limbs. These are generally suitable for younger patients with earlier-stage arthritis that has damaged only one side of the knee joint, says Dr Wang.
 ""An osteotomy shifts weight off the damaged side of the joint by altering knee alignment. This can prolong the lifespan of the knee joint before potential knee replacement surgery,"" he adds.
    Previously, I couldn't walk because of knee pain. Now, I have no problem at all. I've gone back to normal.
    MR LIU SYN THYE, who had a proximal fibular osteotomy in October 2020 on his right knee, which he injured while playing golf in Malaysia  Knee osteotomies are generally less common than knee replacements.
 At Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, the number of lower limb osteotomies carried out last year was 10 per cent of knee replacement operations done.
 But this type of knee preservation surgery is becoming more popular, for example, at Singapore General Hospital (SGH), which had about 100 cases of osteotomies for knee preservation last year, up from nearly 50 cases in 2020.
  CAN KNEE REPLACEMENTS BE AVOIDED' Dr Lee Kong Hwee, a consultant at the department of orthopaedic surgery and director of SGH's Sport Service, says knee preservation surgery can include cartilage and meniscus transplants, ligament reconstruction and osteotomies.
 Two types of osteotomies are conducted at SGH.
 The first is a modified high tibial osteotomy (HTO), where a bone graft wedge is inserted into the shin bone and held in place with a titanium plate, to realign the knee and take weight off the damaged part.
 The second common surgery is a proximal fibular osteotomy (PFO), where a small part of the calf bone is removed to redistribute weight equally across the knee joint.
 No implants are needed for the PFO, making it suitable for people unable to tolerate a metal implant due to poor immunity or diabetes, among other factors.
 Dr Lee says knee preservation surgery techniques have improved in recent years. ""While such improved knee preservation surgery is being done in Singapore only in recent years, studies from overseas show that 80 per cent of patients who had HTO do not need knee replacements, 10 years after the surgery,"" he says.
 Prof Hui says joint preservation is important. ""Natural knee joints are always better than artificial knee joints. In younger patients with less severe knee osteoarthritis, knee preservation surgery can maintain their natural knee joints and delay knee replacement surgery.
 ""With increasing lifespan, early knee replacement might require future multiple revision knee replacement surgery, which will be less ideal in the long run.""
 Mr Liu Syn Thye, 67, hopes he will not need a knee replacement in the future. He injured his right knee while playing golf in Malaysia and sought treatment almost two years after the initial injury.
 He tried to manage the pain with painkillers, but opted for surgery when the discomfort became unbearable. He had a PFO at SGH in October 2020 and followed that with a rehabilitation exercise regimen at home.
 The retiree, who used to work in printing services, says he no longer feels pain while moving and goes for a 60-to 90-minute walk every morning.
 The best part is he can play with his two grandchildren, aged seven and one. ""Previously, I couldn't walk because of knee pain. Now, I have no problem at all. I've gone back to normal,"" he says.
      TIPS FOR HEALTHY KNEES Knee osteoarthritis can cause knee pain and affect a person's ability to exercise and even move.
 When it comes to treating pain and other issues related to knee osteoarthritis, experts recommend non-surgical interventions first.
 Dr Ong Kee Leong, a senior consultant in sports medicine and orthopaedic surgery at the private Synergy Orthopaedic Group, recommends identifying the triggers that cause knee pain and modifying these activities to put less stress on the knee.
 Orthotics such as knee braces and insoles might also help.
 ""Always listen to your body and don't ignore early aches and pains. They are always effective warning signs,"" says Dr Ong.
 He recommends getting advice from a trainer or coach before embarking on a new exercise activity. Progressive training programmes help prevent injuries. Warming up before exercise and cooling down afterwards is also important.
 He recommends treating knee pain with rest and oral medications such as anti-inflammatories, and also physiotherapy. ""Surgery should usually be the last resort,"" he says.
 Professor James Hui, head and senior consultant at the National University Hospital's department of orthopaedic surgery, says surgery can be considered after conservative treatments such as physiotherapy have failed.
 He notes that risk factors for osteoarthritis include overuse injuries, genetic factors and being overweight. Additional weight puts extra stress on the joints and obesity ""may have metabolic effects that increase the risk of osteoarthritis"".
 Maintaining a healthy weight will help reduce the risk of developing osteoarthritis, says Dr Lee Kong Hwee, consultant at Singapore General Hospital's department of orthopaedic surgery. He is also the director of Sport Service at the hospital.
 He adds: ""Avoid prolonged squatting, which will increase the pressure and deterioration within the knee joint.""

199,"Diagnosed with uncommon ovarian cancer at 28, former air stewardess hangs on to hope of having baby after marriage
Today (Singapore) - Online
April 30, 2022 Saturday","SINGAPORE - When Ms Natasha Fong felt a wave of intense abdominal pain and bloating in June 2020, she thought she had caught a stomach bug. She sought medical attention two days later when the bloating did not subside. The sudden symptoms turned out to be an uncommon type of ovarian cancer called ovarian yolk sac tumour. Scans showed a cyst about the size of a soccer ball in the ovary on her right side. A tumour was wrapped around the massive growth. 
Only 28 at the time, Ms Fong, a former flight attendant, was thrown into the bleakest period of her young adult life. Facing a cancer diagnosis at the first peak of the Covid-19 pandemic also tested her mental resilience like never before. She lost an ovary and self-confidence while experiencing severe side effects from cancer treatment. There was also the fear that her ability to have children would be affected. ""Dealing with the side effects from treatment was one of the toughest things I've experienced. Another was having to deal with the changes in appearance and body image,"" Ms Fong, now 30, said in an interview with TODAY to mark awareness week this month for adolescents and young adults who have cancer. The annual global movement aims to raise awareness of the unique challenges young cancer patients and survivors face. MORE TEENAGERS AND YOUNG ADULTS HAVE CANCER Worldwide, cancer in younger people is becoming more common. Ms Fong is one of more than 6,000 adolescent and young adult patients seen at the National Cancer Centre, Singapore (NCCS) between 2016 and 2021. They are between the ages of 16 and 45. Together with other young cancer survivors, she will talk about her cancer experience at a webinar organised by NCCS and Singapore General Hospital on Saturday (April 30) from 1pm to 4.30pm. Dr Eileen Poon, a consultant with NCCS' division of medical oncology, said that worldwide, the number of adolescent and young adult cancers is expected to rise. A reason for the increase could be better and earlier diagnostic rates. Other factors include more exposure to harmful toxins such as alcohol and smoking, as well as patients previously diagnosed with childhood cancers living longer to get secondary cancers, Dr Poon added. Some studies suggested a link between rising obesity rates in the young and an increase in certain cancers, such as colorectal cancer. Family history and genetics may also play a part in the development of cancer in some young people. Lymphomas, sarcomas, germ cell tumours, breast cancer and central nervous system tumours tend to be more common in the younger age group. Ovarian cancers, which form up to 15 per cent of cancer cases in women in Singapore, are among the more commonly seen cancers in female adolescents and young adults. However, ovarian yolk sac tumour is not as common, and NCCS sees fewer than 10 of such cases each year. Dr Poon said that yolk sac tumours primarily occur in younger women and can affect girls even before they hit puberty. About 30 per cent of patients are diagnosed before their menstruation starts. SYMPTOMS MAY MIMIC PREGNANCY SIGNS Besides intense abdominal pain and bloating, Ms Fong also felt an unusual lump on her lower abdomen, which she said made her look ""four to five months' pregnant"". Dr Poon said that ovarian yolk sac tumours often produce hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which can result in symptoms of pregnancy, such as nausea, morning sickness and tiredness. They may also cause precocious puberty and abnormal vaginal bleeding. ""The tumour can cause bloating and abdominal girth enlargement. It may present as a lump in the abdomen and this can be a result of the tumour itself, or fluid accumulating in the abdomen due to the tumour."" Some patients also experience pain. As the pain can be rather acute, it can sometimes be misdiagnosed as appendicitis, Dr Poon said. Some yolk sac tumours can also potentially result in encephalitis, which is an inflammation of the brain caused by an infection or an autoimmune response. It can lead to abnormal behaviour, changes in personalities and swinging heart rates, Dr Poon added. If left untreated, the tumour in Ms Fong's ovary would have continued to grow and could potentially rupture. Dr Poon said that recovery is generally good for patients with ovarian yolk sac tumour. When the cancer is at stage 1, almost all patients will survive. ""Even when they are diagnosed at stage 3, the five-year survival rates can be higher than 70 per cent."" INFERTILITY FEARS, BODY IMAGE ISSUES Ms Fong recalled everything moving at a fast pace after the tumour was discovered. An emergency surgery was scheduled on the same day. She struggled to accept the possibility that her fertility may be severely affected, if the tumour had spread and the surgeon had to remove her entire reproductive system. ""It was quite difficult for me to accept that because I'm still young and not married yet,"" she said. ""The thought that I might have to remove everything and not be able to have kids next time made me quite sad. But my priority at the time was to get well and save my life rather than get emotional thinking about the future."" Thankfully, she added, the tumour was confined to her right ovary and at stage 1. Her ovary on the left side was spared. Ms Fong underwent six months of chemotherapy, during which she spent a total of four weeks in hospital. The treatment left her feeling drained and with severe side effects such as decreased lung function, fatigue, hair loss and intense body aches and pain. ""I expected (the side effects from cancer treatment) to be bad, but didn't realise that it would be so bad."" The toughest part, however, was not having her family members around during treatment. As it was during the early part of the Covid-19 pandemic, her family living in Malaysia could not travel to Singapore due to travel restrictions. Her fiance and close friends, one of whom would cook healthy meals for her when she was hospitalised, were her pillars of strength. When she decided to shave her head while experiencing hair loss from chemotherapy, they rallied around her and did the same as well. One of her friends organised a fundraising drive in support of cancer research and ovarian cancer awareness, raising around S$11,000 for Singapore Cancer Society. Over in Malaysia, Ms Fong's mother shaved her head to show support for her daughter's struggles. Ms Fong said: ""I remember crying a few times when I realised my hair was falling out, even though I told myself that it would be okay. But I took it quite well in the end because people around me were supportive."" She decided not to freeze her eggs due to the costs and time involved. Going ahead with fertility preservation would lead to a delay in the cancer treatment, which was a risk that she chose not to undertake. The Singapore permanent resident said that she was not able to get a subsidy for fertility preservation procedures at the time because she was not married. This was explained to her by a doctor before her cancer treatment, she added. About 85 per cent of adolescent and young adult cancer patients achieve long-term survival beyond five years, but Dr Poon from NCCS pointed out that this would also mean an increasing population of people who will need survivorship care. A cancer diagnosis is difficult for anyone, but young people deal with many challenges that are unique to their age group. An example is the risk of recurrence and living with the damage caused by the cancer, Dr Poon said. ""Some of the challenges they face can also be treatment-related, where the toxicities of treatment can be acute or long-term. There is also the risk of a second cancer that can develop later on,"" she added. For instance, fertility problems and premature menopause are possible issues that can develop - as a direct result from treatment or as a late side effect. The patient may also face significant emotional and social challenges, such depression, anxiety and body image concerns. ""Adolescents and young adults are 'supposed' to be at the peak of their physical health, going through major life milestones such as finishing school, going to university, starting work or a family. To manage all of these while coping with a cancer diagnosis can be devastating,"" Dr Poon said. ""Re-integration back into society or school can be a challenge, too, because they often need to take a hiatus from what they are doing to focus on treatment."" Ms Fong was on hospitalisation leave for about 10 months. Now that the cancer is in remission, she is looking forward to many new beginnings this year. She recently visited her family living in Malaysia after border controls were lifted. Next month, she will start a new career in the banking industry. In September, she will tie the knot with her fiance. Ms Fong said that she went for a gynaecological check-up recently and scans showed that her remaining ovary ""seems normal"". ""I hope to have a kid. I've always wanted to start a family,"" she said. Ms Fong encouraged young people battling cancer to persevere and surround themselves with supportive people. ""Even though you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel while going through treatment, just hold on. Believe that once you go through this toughest part of your journey, everything will go upwards from then on,"" she said. ""Some people may feel it's taboo to tell others they have cancer but I feel it's important to have a lot of support when you're going through it. ""I think one of the reasons why I was so positive (despite having severe treatment side effects) was because of my friends and loved ones' support.""

Telemedicine firms increasing offerings as demand rises; Users tapping services unrelated to Covid-19 as pandemic sparks mindset shift on telecare
The Straits Times (Singapore)
May 1, 2022 Sunday","The days of taking virtual antigen rapid tests (ART) might be over, but telemedicine providers continue to see new opportunities in the post-Covid-19 world.
 The pandemic had allowed telemedicine to become an accepted alternative to seeing a doctor physically, which in turn has driven the sector's expansion, said service providers. This shift in mindset has allowed them to set their sights on bigger plans such as deeper technological innovation and providing more services.
 Doctor Anywhere said it has about 2,500 consultations a day in Singapore, about a fivefold increase from before the pandemic.
 Chief executive and founder Lim Wai Mun said: ""Covid-19 has also accelerated the use of telehealth beyond GP consultations.
 ""We have seen a strong adoption rate for other telehealth services, including chronic disease management, remote ARTs and consultations with specialists such as mental wellness professionals and paediatricians to provide treatment planning and support.""
 He added that the company had scaled up rapidly to support the demand for tele-ARTs.
 ""We are also heartened to see that a large proportion of our remote ART users are also tapping other telehealth and related services in our app,"" he noted.
 Fellow telemedicine provider Speedoc has also seen a jump in the usage of its app from pre-pandemic days. People, such as the elderly, can use the app to book a doctor to visit them at home. In 2019, Speedoc conducted an average of about 20 home visits for patients a day, but that number has increased fortyfold across the different services it provides.
 It has also grown staff numbers, from 15 pre-pandemic to 150 now across Singapore and Malaysia.
 And while the demand for supervised tele-ARTs has declined, it has not petered out entirely.
 Co-founder Serene Cai said: ""We are still seeing bookings for patrons who are required to present a negative result before entering nightclubs, and swab tests for cruise trips for overseas travel.""
    STRONG DEMAND  We have seen a strong adoption rate for other telehealth services, including chronic disease management, remote ARTs and consultations with specialists such as mental wellness professionals and paediatricians to provide treatment planning and support.
    DOCTOR ANYWHERE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND FOUNDER LIM WAI MUN,  on how Covid-19 has accelerated the use of telehealth beyond GP consultations.    BEHAVIOURAL CHANGE  The fact that users are actively seeking out telehealth services for issues beyond pandemic-related initiatives points to a permanent behavioural change in the patient population.
    MYDOC CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND CO-FOUNDER SNEHAL PATEL,  who said the use of pandemic-related services allowed patients to not only see the benefits of remote care for Covid-19 issues, but also the benefits of using telehealth services for their daily health needs.  Similarly, average daily consults at telehealth firm MyDoc jumped fivefold compared with pre-Covid-19 days.
 Chief executive and co-founder Snehal Patel noted that although the use of pandemic-related services has decreased, he is seeing a steady increase in the take-up of MyDoc's other offerings, such as in chronic disease follow-up and medication fulfilment.
 He said: ""I believe that through the use of pandemic-related telehealth services, patients who were new to telehealth had the opportunity to not only see the benefits of remote care for Covid-19 related issues, but also realised the benefits of using telehealth services for their daily health needs.
 ""The fact that users are actively seeking out telehealth services for issues beyond pandemic-related initiatives points to a permanent behavioural change in the patient population.""
 These include patients using services for home-based flu vaccination, health screening with a virtual follow-up and even a ""Ask-a-Pharmacist"" chat, where they can get general advice from a Guardian pharmacist.
 Indeed, telemedicine can help support the Health Ministry's plan to encourage residents to enrol with a general practitioner (GP) as their first touchpoint of care.
 Dr Patel said: ""Our platform encourages users to connect with GPs via an online consult, which can seamlessly transition into offline care where needed, and back online for a continuous care process with the wider care team.
 ""The continuous care process allows the care team to be familiar with the patient's conditions and lifestyle circumstances, allowing them to better detect any potential health issues and prevent further complications in the future.""
 Speedoc is also helping to support this transition to more seamless care, Ms Cai said. It started a virtual hospital programme called H-Ward, which aims to enable eligible patients to remain at home to recuperate in comfort and privacy.
 It is working with the National University Health System, Singapore General Hospital and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in a two-year pilot trial to provide hospital-level care for patients at home.
 ""Initial findings are already showing that patients are being discharged earlier and overall healthcare spend is reduced,"" Ms Cai said. ""Patients also benefit from a reduced risk of cross-infection and recover in familiar surroundings with their loved ones.""
 Meanwhile, Doctor Anywhere's focus in the next one to two years is to leverage technology and data to help translate its healthcare expertise into delivering better and more convenient patient care.
 This means investing in big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence tools, as well as building predictive analytics capabilities.
 It also hopes to provide more mental wellness support, especially after the pandemic shone a light on mental health challenges, Mr Lim said.",,30-04-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999974090877034}",en,0.9999974090877034

May 4, 2022 Wednesday","A number of hospitals have generally seen an uptick in the number of rhabdomyolysis cases in recent times, with the Singapore General Hospital's (SGH) emergency department seeing the average number of monthly exertional rhabdomyolysis - a breakdown of muscle from extreme physical exertion - cases increase from four in 2020 to 10 last year.
 Rhabdomyolysis is essentially the breakdown of muscle tissues and the resultant leakage of their content into blood circulation. It can cause serious complications, including kidney failure or even death.
 The condition may occur due to several reasons, including crush injuries and alcohol or drug abuse.
 Some factors that can increase one's risk of rhabdomyolysis include over-exertion during exercise, inadequate hydration or nutrition and exercising when one is ill or on certain medications.
 Medical experts believe one reason for the upward trend in exertional rhabdomyolysis cases could be the Covid-19 pandemic, which has resulted in extreme changes to exercise habits for some.
 Dr Benjamin Ang, a consultant at the department of orthopaedic surgery at the SGH, said: ""The pandemic has likely increased the number of people getting into fitness, including many who were previously inactive.
 ""Restrictions in group numbers may have also resulted in a change in the type of exercise people do. These may have contributed to the increase in the number of cases.""
 Even though all strenuous exercises can theoretically lead to rhabdomyolysis, it usually occurs in those who are unaccustomed to such exercises, and over-exert themselves, said Dr Mong Rupeng, a senior consultant at the Changi General Hospital's (CGH) department of emergency medicine.
 He added that the condition seldom hits those who do endurance runs or road cycling. But the popularity of spin cycling, however, has seen young patients suffering from exertional rhabdomyolysis.
 While the CGH was unable to ascertain whether there has been an increase in the number of cases at the hospital, Dr Mong said the rhabdomyolysis cases at its emergency department typically involve ""young adults presenting with severe thigh pain or passing dark brown urine several days after their first spin class"".
 There are certain factors that may contribute to rhabdomyolysis occurring more among beginners at spin classes as compared to other forms of cycling.
 Dr Mong said: ""Compared to outdoor cycling, external factors that may decrease the sustained intensity of exercise such as the need to turn, avoid obstacles or stop for traffic are removed in spin cycling.
 ""Spin cycling is done in a comfortable air-conditioned environment free of obstacles, where participants are kept engaged with loud and fast tempo music. Projected videos and dimmed lights during the session serve as encouragement to participants to push themselves harder. There may also be pressure to 'ride with the pack'.""
 Common symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include severe muscle aches, weakness or swelling in affected muscles and red or brown discolouration of urine.
 There are also other less common symptoms such as generalised body aches, fever, rapid heart beating at rest, as well as nausea and vomiting.
 Dr Benjamin Soh, a registrar at the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital's department of sports and exercise medicine, also highlighted that not all individuals with the condition experience symptoms.
 In such cases, additional blood and urine testing can help to confirm whether the patient is suffering from rhabdomyolysis.
 While Dr Soh noted that rhabdomyolysis related to strenuous conditions is ""fairly rare"" as compared to instances caused by trauma, he also offered advice on certain precautions individuals can take to reduce the risk of developing the condition.
 One such way is to start slow and progress gradually when it comes to exercise.
 He said: ""Being good at one type of exercise does not necessarily mean you will automatically be good at all types. Always take several sessions to familiarise yourself and build tolerance to the specific exercises you will be doing.""
 Other precautions include avoiding exercising under extremely hot and humid conditions, wearing light and non-restrictive clothing as well as staying hydrated.
 One should also avoid exercising when unwell and/or taking cough and cold medicines, which can reduce sweating.
 The SGH's Dr Ang stressed the need for both participants and instructors to be educated and aware of the ways to prevent exertional rhabdomyolysis, which include adequate rest and recovery in between sessions.
    PEER PRESSURE TO KEEP UP  Spin cycling... participants are kept engaged with loud and fast tempo music. Projected videos and dimmed lights during the session serve as encouragement to participants to push themselves harder. There may also be pressure to 'ride with the pack'.

202,"Our covid-19 stories
The Straits Times (Singapore)
May 5, 2022 Thursday","One healthcare worker came into contact with an infected patient from abroad before Covid-19 got its name.
 Another had to tell a patient's widow why she could not grieve next to his body.
 All of them had no idea Covid-19 would be here to stay.
 These stories by staff from Singapore General Hospital (SGH) are profoundly told in its book, Purpose With Passion: Our Covid-19 Stories, which was launched on April 24. The following are the edited accounts of four workers taken from the book, which can be accessed in instalments online at https://www.sgh.com.sg/OurCovid-19Stories
  'It was adrenaline that kept me going'  Internal medicine resident Samuel Koh ""Hi doctor, there is a patient for admission.""
 As a medical officer on night float - the practice of returning for night duty on one's day off - we probably hear this at least 15 times a night. Little did I know that this was going to be my first contact with a patient harbouring the novel virus.
 When I walked in to see the patient, he was coughing vigorously. I reviewed the epidemiological history and found out that he was from Wuhan.
 ""Did you go to the seafood market'"" I asked instinctively, as the infamous seafood market was already synonymous with the virus.
 He denied it initially, but after I probed a second time, he said: ""Actually, I visited the market with my son about three weeks ago.""
 The silence that ensued was deafening. Between the patient and myself, I suppose, we both had a gut feeling of what that meant.
 There was plenty to do after that. Taking his swabs, keying in my findings, calling the infectious diseases consultant on call, and notifying the Ministry of Health - all of which had to be done within one hour of his admission.
 The patient's son was outside, gesticulating frantically and coughing - without a mask!
 He was eager to find out when the swab result would be ready. I handed him a mask and recalled asking, or probably berating, him to go to the emergency department. It was adrenaline that kept me going through the rest of the shift.
 At the back of my mind, the uncertainty of the whole situation remained perturbing.
 The next day, at about 9pm, while I was again busy in Ward 68, my phone buzzed incessantly. After I de-gowned, I saw many messages of support, with some directing me to check my e-mail. It felt almost surreal the moment I read the memo that the patient I had seen yesterday had tested positive for the Wuhan virus. From that point on, there was no letting up.
 After my week of night float, the whole of Ward 68 was full; uncertainty became the new normal.
  'We had thought our seniors were overreacting'  Internal medicine resident Tan Sye Nee The moment I touched down at Changi Airport on day three of Chinese New Year, I got a call from my senior asking for volunteers at the isolation ward.
 I had been home in Malaysia for the holidays. Before leaving home, I had reassured my mum: ""Don't worry, I'm in haematology. I'm very safe.""
 In movies, people would want to be the hero and would readily volunteer their services. But when I was asked whether I would risk my life to do this, knowing there was no cure if infected, I hesitated. ""Should I even do this'"" I asked myself.
 Then I thought, since I was living alone in Singapore, even if I got infected, there would be less risk to others. Many of my medical officer friends were married or living with their parents.
 Initially, I did not want to tell my mum because she had been really worried as my brother had just gone to China to be with his wife. I didn't want to add to her worries.
 But if I didn't tell her, I wouldn't be able to make up my mind to step up. I eventually called her, and she understood and agreed with my decision.
 When I joined the team in the isolation ward, I wasn't very sure whether or not I would be safe, but the infectious diseases department and our seniors really took great care of us.
 The senior consultants would check in with us every single day, to ask how we were doing. When we had to use the full personal protective equipment (PPE), they took great care to ensure that all the steps we took were correct.
 After managing the first few imported cases, we thought the worst was over. We were then shocked to diagnose the illness in a local resident who had not travelled and who did not have a clear history of contact with a known case.
 Fortunately, our seniors had been very protective and made us wear the full set of PPE throughout. Honestly, we had thought they were overreacting, being kiasu.
 But in the light of the newly confirmed patient, who we had thought was of really low risk, we finally understood why they were so cautious. That gave me the assurance that we were working in a safe and well-protected environment.
  Testing migrant workers - it was a colossal operation  Consultant Lim Chin Siah At that time, we thought it was a one-off thing for the migrant workers. We knew it was going to be a large number but didn't know how it would unfold. The largest number swabbed at a single time then was just a few hundred.
    MUCH-NEEDED HELP  Thanks to the National Dental Centre Singapore, 40 dentists and nurses came to our aid, and we managed more than 1,500 swabs over six hours that day. That record became the benchmark.
    CONSULTANT LIM CHIN SIAH, on being part of a team swabbing migrant workers to test them for Covid-19.  That Easter Sunday morning, while walking to the Redhill site, I saw cranes lifting mattresses through the windows of the empty Housing Board flats. These workers had been relocated at short notice.
 There was apprehension all around. The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) had set up a tent for us. They were registering the workers for us, getting them ready to be tested.
 All we had to do was swab and label the specimens, and send them off to the laboratory. It was a colossal operation, and the choke point was at registration, which was done manually. Each swab took just a few minutes.
 After the swab, there were again long queues, this time to collect care packs containing SIM cards. So, the SAF had to deploy manpower over there too - they were running all over the place.
 Thanks to the National Dental Centre Singapore, 40 dentists and nurses came to our aid, and we managed more than 1,500 swabs over six hours that day. That record became the benchmark.
 In the midst of the sweltering heat as the swabbers worked outdoors in full PPE - disposable gowns, gloves, N95 masks and goggles - SGH and SingHealth leaders turned up offering support, including a surprise bubble tea treat.
 SGH chief executive Kenneth Kwek gave me $500 cash to buy drinks. After paying for them, I had a few hundred dollars left.
 ""How do I return this to CEO'"" I wondered, naively thinking that the swabbing was going to last only a few days.
  'I was fully gowned up - no way to wipe my tears'  Senior staff nurse Lee Shu Zhen It was tough to listen in on their parting words. I was fully gowned up - there was no way for me to wipe my tears. I tried to distract myself with the tasks in the room. To hear but not to listen.
 The patient was struggling to stay alive, the numbers on the monitors were blinking red, and the loved ones could only look through glass doors.
 There was a phrase, I thought - ah, ""so near yet so far"". What should have been a final loving touch was reduced to an intercom encouragement: ""Stay strong, fight on.""
 I was told to do three video calls for my patient, one with each of his children. I had to be in the room, listening to their conversations. As the nurse, I had to do it. The call of duty. Each conversation was supposed to last 15 minutes. I had to do it three times.
 And then the ECG (electrocardiogram) flatlined. What do you tell the children? But somehow they knew.
 The patient's wife arrived at the ward to see him. A scene that burned into my heart. A pair of lovebirds separated by the anteroom. She pleaded to be allowed to enter the room, to at least be inside the anteroom. We declined. I explained why but those words - those were stabbing words.
 It felt morally wrong to let an elder beg to see her love for the very last time, to exchange a final touch.
 But the stakes were too high. We had an obligation to the nation. It was for a greater good but at the expense of their grief. Protecting our people took precedence over their grief. An obligation we had to uphold, whether it was morally right or not.
 All I could do was apologise.
 The word ""sorry"" could never describe the guilt I felt and could never fill the void in their grieving hearts.
 With the medical social worker nodding his assent, I offered a final video call, to bridge this physical gap between the two doors. Maybe the family could have closure.
 The patient's wife finally broke down and acknowledged his death, while I stood in the patient's room, holding the phone as close to his face as possible. Guilt ate into me but it had to be done this way. Do no harm.
 Beneficence to our people. This was the call of duty.",The Straits Times (Singapore),4-05-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999977660502625}",en,0.9999977660502625
203,"Moving forward with lessons from Covid-19
The Straits Times (Singapore)
May 7, 2022 Saturday","Singapore needs to make the most of the changes forced on it by the coronavirus pandemic to improve the way it does things even as it shifts to a strategy of living with Covid-19 from the early days of a zero-Covid strategy. The trials and tribulations of the past two years have provided lessons in resilience and survival that need to be kept in mind so the country is prepared for the arrival of Disease X, an unknown new pathogen that is highly transmissible, highly lethal and mutates easily. Covid-19 was bad enough, testing the sinews of every society around the globe. The new disease could raise the stakes even higher in what would be another major epidemiological assault on societies that have already faced casualties over time from the Spanish flu in the 20th century, the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak this century, and Covid-19 most recently. Living with Covid-19 means taking a realistic view of a future in which sudden pandemics will challenge the ingenuity of medical science and the capacity for coherence of society at large.
 Singapore must prepare for that day now. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's recent remarks at the Singapore General Hospital Lecture suggest the way forward. A key insight is that Singapore would have to keep investing in public health as in healthcare. Healthcare focuses on providing the best possible medical treatment for individual patients, whereas public health focuses on the state of health of the overall population. During a pandemic, public health draws on the entire panoply of public policies, including non-medical intervention, to manage and limit the spread of a devastating disease.
 Singapore must thus be able to prioritise its resources during trying circumstances to benefit as many people as possible. Good medical facilities and infrastructure, support for healthcare workers, the shoring up of scientific and biomedical capabilities, and international collaboration in research will need to continue in an epidemiological peacetime so that the public health infrastructure holds up when Disease X strikes unexpectedly and brutally. Individual Singaporeans play a part in this national project too.
 Healthy habits add to the lifespan and quality of life of an ageing population, particularly of those who are beset with chronic diseases. Then, keeping in touch with a regular family physician, for example, would draw citizens into the protective ambit of preventive health plans, including regular screening and attention given to risk factors, instead of them seeing a general practitioner for treatment only when sick. Not only would preventive healthcare benefit individuals, but it would also make national expenditure on health more sustainable. That way, Singapore would be better prepared financially to meet the exigencies of a public health emergency.",The Straits Times (Singapore),6-05-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999963619580636}",en,0.9999963619580636
204,"Moving beyond covid-19; As Singapore eases most pandemic restrictions after two years, Insight explores how the Republic and its people might find a new way forward in a more challenging landscape
The Straits Times (Singapore)
May 7, 2022 Saturday","Over the past month, as Singapore took its most decisive strides towards life as it was before the pandemic, it appeared to be fulfilling a prognosis by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in October last year.
 In a national address on the Covid-19 situation, he indicated that it could take up to six months to reach a state of living with the virus. ""How will we know when we have arrived at the new normal? It will be when we can ease off restrictions, have just light SMMs (safe management measures) in place, and cases remain stable - perhaps hundreds a day, but not growing,"" said PM Lee then.
 ""When we can resume doing the things we used to do, and see crowds again without getting worried or feeling strange.""
 Since April 26, Singapore has jettisoned most of its Covid-19 curbs, save for the stipulation to keep wearing masks indoors and on public transport. But daily caseloads, while steadily falling from the Omicron variant-fuelled highs of February, remain in the thousands.
 Some people interviewed over the past few weeks have cited the high number of infections as reason to take precautions by continuing to don masks outdoors.
 And for every individual capitalising on the elimination of group size and safe distancing limits to paint the town red, there are just as likely others who are cautiously sticking to the small gatherings they have become attuned to over the past two years.
 Singapore finds itself in this liminal stage as it mounts a recovery effort from a pandemic that has infected some 1.2 million and killed more than 1,300 here while imposing widespread social and economic disruption and straining more than a few societal fault lines.
 How the Republic translates the lessons learnt from the crisis will be closely watched by others attempting similar transitions.
 The challenge will be to locate a new equilibrium - in how its people live, play and work; and in the compact between state and citizens - amid a raft of present and emerging uncertainties both internal and external.
 Fairness, inclusivity and openness ought to be guiding principles in a ground-up and continually iterative undertaking, as experts and observers tell Insight.
 Dr Lim Wee Kiat, associate director of the Centre for Management Practice at Singapore Management University (SMU), says neither governments, businesses, non-profits, academics nor public intellectuals should enjoy a monopoly over perspectives on the most complex issues. ""The vulnerable communities - be they migrant workers, the economically disadvantaged, or seniors who live alone - should be given a seat at the table, so that they can also help shape the solution that they are subject to,"" adds the sociologist, who studies how organisations recover from crises.
 ""This 'all of us' approach should become the modus operandi in our whole-of-society model.""
  SHIFTING MINDSETS On May 7, 2020, while in the throes of a circuit breaker lockdown from April to June, Singapore reported 10 community cases of Covid-19, next to 724 in the migrant workers' dormitories.
 A year later, amid an outbreak caused by the Delta variant, the authorities tightened both border and safe management measures, including a reduction of permissible group sizes from eight to five persons. The number of community infections on May 7, 2021 stood at four, with 21 imported.
 In contrast, daily local infections have hovered upwards of 1,300 since April 22, when Health Minister Ong Ye Kung described Singapore as being in a position where it can ""afford to take further steps to restore pre-Covid-19 normalcy"".
 The sweeping changes include, among others, the lowering of the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon) level from orange - where Singapore has been since February 2020 - to yellow; optional mask-wearing outdoors; allowing all workers to return to their offices; and the scrapping of the TraceTogether and SafeEntry contact tracing tools.
 A confluence of factors made this possible. Hospitalisation numbers are down, about 96 per cent of the eligible population have completed their full vaccination regimen, and 74 per cent have received booster shots. Nearly 900,000 people have also caught Covid-19 since the start of 2022 - with the real number likely higher - granting protection from immunity.
 The circulating virus in its current incarnation is also relatively mild even if very transmissible, as infectious disease modelling expert Alex Cook told The Straits Times' online news programme The Big Story earlier this week.
 ""Singapore's Covid-19 situation is now at the best since December 2019,"" said the associate professor at the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. ""Effectively, we are leaving it up to individuals to make their own decisions about whether and how to modify their lifestyles and protect themselves, rather than having the Government make those decisions for us.""
 This necessary shift in mindset will inevitably encounter some inertia among the population, says Dr Woo Jun Jie, a senior research fellow in the governance and economy department at the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) think-tank.
 The noticeable choice made by some to continue wearing masks outdoors is one example. He says: ""It will take time and effort, in the form of public messaging from the government, to assure individuals that it is indeed safe to loosen Covid-19 restrictions in light of Singapore's high rate of vaccination.""
 Associate Professor Sulfikar Amir from Nanyang Technological University, who researches risk and disaster, notes that Singapore's population has been living under restrictions for some two years now - enough time to shape behaviours that internalise health protocols and precautions at both individual and communal levels. ""Habits of reducing risk of infection will stay for a longer time and remain part of our new normal culture,"" he says, adding that Singaporeans' acceptance of such conditions could be a factor in the country's success in handling the pandemic and averting high fatality rates as seen in other countries.
 But Dr Joanne Yoong, senior economist and director at the University of Southern California's (USC) Centre for Economic and Social Research, believes a mentality of opening up has been effectively settling in for some time, with accounts from other countries resonating with people here. ""So making the mindset shift to the endemic phase is, on the ground, not a sharp reversal. The public are ready to live life,"" she says. ""However, finding a middle ground especially with respect to individual responsibility is indeed challenging. We know the virus is incredibly adaptable and we also know that managing the long tail of Covid-19 complications is still to come.""
 Singaporeans also run the risk of underappreciating one important fact, says Dr Yoong, who is also a visiting associate professor at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at National University Hospital. ""That we are not 'free' of Covid-19 because Covid-19 has ceased to exist, but because we are able to manage the threat through vaccination and health and social system strengthening.""
 For Associate Professor Terence Ho from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP), a continued precautionary stance is a positive. ""The exercise of personal responsibility and judgment is an important part of the transition to the new normal,"" he says.
 Beyond the individual, it is also about decisions made by organisations on whether to retain norms from the Covid-19 era - like workers staying away from the office when ill and without a need for medical certificates, says Dr Lim from SMU. ""Management and business owners may see such measures as temporary, taken only to cope with the public health crisis,"" he adds. ""Once the danger passes, some may feel it is time to ditch them, especially when such actions come with no legal or regulatory repercussions.""
  RETAINING NORMS, VALUES In January, pest control technician A. Rahim M. Taha, 60, was jailed for five weeks for refusing a Covid-19 swab test for fear of forfeiting a monthly work incentive. He had been sick but continued working in a job which paid $1,500 a month and offered an additional $100 for not taking medical leave.
 There has been at least one other case of an individual jailed for opting to work through Covid-19 symptoms - with one security officer explaining that he needed to ""survive and put food on the table"".
 Mr Rahim's case prompted President Halimah Yacob to write on Facebook that in the pandemic, it would not be fair to deprive workers of their attendance allowance when they go on medical leave for being Covid-19-positive or awaiting their test results. ""The real solution is to make sure that low-wage workers are paid better so that they don't have to depend on such incentives to survive,"" she said.
 Labelled the ""inequality virus"", Covid-19 has exposed and exacerbated existing fissures in society along class, race, nationality and gender lines; with those at the margins hit disproportionately hard. ""While we are all floating on the same sea, it's clear that some are in super yachts, while others are clinging to the drifting debris,"" said United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres in July 2020.
 Says Prof Ho: ""The uneven impact of Covid-19 - in both human health and economic terms - has underscored the importance of fairness and inclusion within societies as well as across borders.""
 He adds that social protection needs to be enhanced for the economically vulnerable - such as the lower-income and freelance workers - to boost incomes and savings, and reduce their vulnerability to job or income loss. He also notes that retraining has to be stepped up, especially for mature workers aged 40 and above.
 This year's Budget makes some headway in these areas. Finance Minister Lawrence Wong has said that lower-income groups will benefit the most from measures such as significant utility rebates and cash vouchers for daily expenses, as well as extending support through progressive wages and the Workfare scheme. A new career transition initiative provides mid-career workers with highly subsidised, industry-oriented training courses to help them secure jobs.
 Migrant workers bore the brunt of Covid-19 infections in the first year of the pandemic, with case numbers in dorms surging from 31 in April 2020 to 33,000 in June. The workers made up 19 in 20 infections that year, and as at the end of 2021, more than 175,000 out of 275,000-odd dormitory residents had caught the disease.
 The outbreaks also laid bare the cramped and unsanitary living conditions faced by the workers, sparking numerous grassroots aid initiatives and impelling the Government to announce improved standards for dorms last September.
 But there were also parts of the populace - particularly online - faulting the workers for being unhygienic, and blaming them for driving up case numbers. Today, the workers remain largely confined to their living quarters other than for work, essential errands or visits to recreation centres. Over 99 per cent of those living in dormitories are fully vaccinated, but they still need to apply for exit passes to visit public places, and their numbers are capped at 50,000 on weekends and 25,000 on weekdays.
 ""The Government could not have foreseen the outbreaks in migrant worker dormitories because the policy structure by nature is crafted to render invisible the bodies of low-wage migrant workers and silence their voices,"" says Professor Mohan Dutta, director of the Centre for Culture-Centred Approach to Research and Evaluation (Care) at Massey University in New Zealand.
 ""Had low-wage migrant workers had a voice in how policies are developed, adequate and decent housing infrastructures would have already been in place.""
 Some degree of hostility has also been extended to foreigners on the other end of the wage spectrum, with job cuts and business closures heightening concerns and disquiet about high-earning blue-collar workers competing with locals for employment opportunities. The Government's foreign talent policy came under the microscope in 2021, with two parliamentary debates where ministers stressed the need for a balancing act between welcoming foreigners as a complement to the local workforce, and continuing to prioritise and invest in a ""Singaporean core"".
 Singapore's Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement or Ceca trade deal with India was a particular lightning rod in the discourse, with racist and xenophobic undertones.
 Chinese nationals experienced this when the coronavirus started spreading from Wuhan in January 2020. There was also outrage after reports of foreigners at Robertson Quay drinking and flouting social distancing rules in the middle of that year; and in 2021, it was Indian immigrants who were targeted amid reports of record infections and mutant strains in India.
 Locals were swept up in the bile and bigotry, with a spate of incidents and an increase in police reports made over racial and religious matters. Among others, a Chinese man shouted racial slurs at a 55-year-old Indian Singaporean woman and kicked her in the chest; shortly after, a viral video showed a Chinese man accusing a Singaporean man of mixed Indian-Filipino heritage of preying on a Chinese girl.
 These three hot potatoes - race, the place of foreigners, and the plight of lower-wage workers - were identified as fault lines by PM Lee in his National Day message last August. And in his National Day Rally speech, he committed to tackling these issues through landmark measures like an upcoming law on racial harmony.
 Assistant Professor Catherine Wong from the University of Amsterdam's faculty of social and behavioural sciences points out that amid an atmosphere of finger-pointing at minorities and foreigners, there were also segments of society rallying to speak out against such behaviour and mentality.
 ""Covid-19 tested the norms and values we seek to protect in our society, and the everyday rebuttals against racism and discrimination help to keep those norms and values intact,"" she says. ""Going forward, we need to learn the language and etiquette of how to have a civilised debate and dialogue about difficult issues like inequality, migrant workers, race... Now that social media has forced these issues to the surface, we need to have a public discussion about these issues and learn to do so in an open and reflexive way.""
 For USC's Dr Yoong, one key lesson from the impact of Covid-19 is that social capital and cohesion cannot be taken for granted. ""It is not easy, and costly, to be aware of and work with different perspectives, while also trying to establish necessary ways forward,"" she says.
SHAPING COLLECTIVISM
 Recent months have seen PM Lee and other ministers emphasise that it was Singapore's high trust levels - between the people and the Government - which enabled a cohesive and robust response to the public health crisis.
 ""Trust that the Government has the best interest of Singapore and Singaporeans at heart, that the Government is competent and will make the right decisions on behalf of Singaporeans,"" the Prime Minister said last month at the Singapore General Hospital's Lecture and Formal Dinner 2022.
 He pointed to people largely abiding by safe management measures, enduring rounds of easing and tightening, going for vaccinations and booster jabs, and exercising personal and social responsibility.
 Throughout the pandemic, trust in the Government's management of Covid-19 has dipped in tandem with rising caseloads, according to an IPS survey last year. The proportion of those who saw the authorities as exercising good political leadership fell to 53 per cent from Oct 28 to Nov 1, compared to about 70 per cent in July to September.
 The decline in sentiment followed a stretch of frustration and confusion over logistical issues in a protocol switch to home-based isolation. Daily cases were also beginning to climb into the thousands for the first time, as public dissatisfaction congealed around perceptions of stop-start measures and contradictory messaging in the Government's intentions to actually live with Covid-19.
 But observers Insight spoke to argue that a fine line exists between what has been characterised in some quarters as policy flip-flops, and the Government being nimble and flexible enough to make new rules on the fly, in the face of constantly changing and highly-uncertain conditions.
 Pivoting from a Covid-zero approach to an endemic one, for example, shows the authorities being adaptive to the new reality of the pandemic, they say.
 In late October, news that the Bloomberg New Economy Forum would allow foreign delegates to dine in groups of five at designated restaurants roused some public ire and claims of unfairness and inconsistency, given that people here were then limited to a maximum of two when eating out. Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong had to explain that the larger group size would facilitate business networking, and the Forum's requirements - to be fully vaccinated and undergo daily pre-event testing - were stricter than those for the likes of wedding receptions, where attendees were already allowed to dine in groups of five then.
 But the pandemic's sternest test of public trust was perhaps the controversy around TraceTogether, which stemmed from the Government revealing in January last year that - contrary to earlier assurances - the data could be accessed by police for criminal investigations, and that this had been done in May 2020 for a murder case.
 A law was later passed to restrict tapping of this information to investigate seven types of serious crimes; and on April 26 this year, the use of TraceTogether was stepped down with the public no longer needing to check in at most venues, except where vaccination status needs to be shown.
 Prof Ho from LKYSPP says the Government has fundamentally been open and transparent by not suppressing information or seeking to cover up mistakes.
 He and other observers believe that, on balance, the public's trust in the Government has remained intact - although it is just as key to keep strengthening that faith.
 ""Singapore's Covid-19 response has not been perfect, but what is clear is that the nation has come through this generational crisis fairly well in terms of limiting the impact of the pandemic on human lives and livelihoods - certainly better than many other countries have,"" says Prof Ho. ""While there was clearly room for improvement, this should not detract from what was an overall successful response to the pandemic.""
 IPS' Dr Woo points out that Singaporeans have not had to endure a full-scale lockdown apart from the circuit breaker of 2020.
 Says Dr Yoong the economist: ""One thing Covid-19 has taught us is never to be too early to comment on government 'success' or 'failure'. Singapore's image of competent governance on a world stage has not been compromised by Covid-19, and domestically, at this point, the Government is riding the wave of positive opening.
 ""However, given the strong likelihood of economic headwinds ahead and other deeper uncertainties about geopolitics, climate, etc, much remains to be seen.""
 In his May Day Rally speech last week, PM Lee said the cautious optimism around Singapore's post-Covid-19 recovery has now been clouded by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Singaporeans are feeling the war's impact on the cost of living, and the world could face a recession within the next two years, he warned.
 It is in this ""very different and uncertain world"" that Mr Wong will lead Singapore - having been selected last month to head the People's Action Party's fourth-generation (4G) team, thus assuming the mantle of heir apparent to PM Lee.
 Dr Yoong says Mr Wong's leadership style so far ""... signals a recognition that there will be continuity, but politics will not be completely as usual... In the future it will be critical for the Government to (show) that it genuinely listens to and respects the views of its citizens, and holds itself accountable.""
 This must include giving voice to those on the margins of society, says Prof Dutta. ""In Singapore and globally, Covid-19 made evident the limits of technocratic policy-making devoid of participatory democracy,"" he adds. ""It is through participatory voice infrastructures that trust in institutions and government can be built and secured, in addressing the complex challenges of the future.""
 Prof Wong says the emphasis should be on cultivating a bottom-up culture of collective responsibility - rather than a top-down, manufactured and performed collectivism foisted on Singaporeans by a Government-led narrative.
 ""It may be messier, but it will contribute to a more resilient society and better response to risk.""
 Speaking at the May Day Rally, Mr Wong offered a glimpse of his approach as he announced a new 4G-led ""Forward Singapore"" agenda to refresh the social compact and set out a roadmap for the next decade and beyond.
 ""This is not just about what the Government can do for you,"" he said. ""But also, as we learnt throughout this pandemic - what we can all do for one another; and how we can all, collectively, contribute towards building a better society that embodies the values we stand for.""
 Mr Wong's commitment to equal treatment and engagement across the board is not new. But if he makes good on his word in the wake of a defining, teaching moment in history - that the worst of crises can wreak universal havoc without care for identity - then it augurs well in shaping a Singapore with greater parity - and perhaps a better, brighter tomorrow.
    NEW NORMAL  Habits of reducing risk of infection will stay for a longer time and remain part of our new normal culture.
    ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR SULFIKAR AMIR  from Nanyang Technological University, who researches risk and disaster.    FAIRNESS AND INCLUSION  The uneven impact of Covid-19 - in both human health and economic terms - has underscored the importance of fairness and inclusion within societies as well as across borders.
    ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR TERENCE HO   from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy    CIVILISED DEBATE  Going forward, we need to learn the language and etiquette of how to have a civilised debate and dialogue about difficult issues like inequality, migrant workers, race...

The Straits Times (Singapore)
May 9, 2022 Monday","WATCH: PEANUTS MOTHER'S DAY SPECIAL ANIMATION Charlie Brown has got his mum an ice cream cake for Mother's Day. Linus van Pelt is writing a thank-you letter for his mum. Meanwhile, Snoopy is helping Woodstock find his long-lost mum.
 Everyone in the Peanuts gang is excited for the occasion, except for Peppermint Patty, who is feeling left out as she grew up without a mum. But her good friend Marcie helps her realise that she is not missing out on love and Peppermint Patty resolves to celebrate her dad on Mother's Day.
 To Mom (And Dad), With Love is an original animation based on the classic Peanuts comic strip by Charles M. Schulz. Stream it on Apple TV+.
  READ: MY MUMMY LOVES ME MORE! BOOK ""I love my mummy and surely she loves me too'"" the girl wonders time and again. She cannot be sure as her mum has never expressed her love verbally to her.
 My Mummy Loves Me More! is a picture book inspired by author Josephyne Ho's childhood. ""In traditional households like the one my siblings and I grew up in, the word 'love' was never uttered nor were we hugged,"" recalls Ho, 52, a senior principal at EtonHouse Pre-School Mountbatten 223.
 It took her 30 years to be less angry with her mum and to get to know her better, she says. Her mum was 78 when she died in 2018.
 Ho hopes that the book, illustrated by Afiqah M. Suhaimi, will help young readers to love and accept their mothers unconditionally. ""I also hope that parents will say they love their children and hug them as often as they can.""
 Ho and Afiqah have also published My Daddy Is The Best! to pay tribute to fathers.
 Both titles retail for $14.90 each at Books Kinokuniya and Epigram Bookshop.
  LEARN: KIDS CAN BE STROKE HEROES TOO What is happening to grandpa? When he came home from the hospital, he was not his usual self. Mum explains that he had a stroke and how everyone at home - young and old - can support him in his recovery.
 Kids Can Be Stroke Heroes Too, a short animation created by the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI), aims to help children understand the condition better.
 ""A stroke happens in an instant, but the effects are often long-lasting. It affects not just the patient, but also the whole family,"" says Associate Professor Deidre Anne De Silva, head and senior consultant, Department of Neurology, NNI at Singapore General Hospital Campus.
 ""It can be particularly difficult for children to see their once active parent or grandparent having difficulty with everyday tasks such as eating, walking and talking.""
 She says small actions and encouragement from children in the family can make a big difference to the well-being of a stroke survivor.
 For example, slurred speech is a common problem after a stroke. Kids can learn to be patient and listen carefully when a stroke survivor speaks.

Channel NewsAsia
May 11, 2022 Wednesday 10:57 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: A 41-year-old private jet pilot was deported on Wednesday (May 11) after serving a 10-week jail term for drunkenly abusing police officers in 2018.
Cameron Lachlan Milne's Employment Pass has been cancelled and the Australian is not allowed to re-enter Singapore, said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in a release.
In its release, MHA said it has ""zero tolerance of acts of violence against public servants who are carrying out their duties, and will not hesitate to take strong action against those who do so"".
Milne was sentenced on Mar 18 this year to 10 weeks' jail and ordered to pay a S$5,000 fine after pleading guilty to three charges: Voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant discharging his duty, harassing a public servant, and for causing annoyance while drunk, TODAY reported.
Five other charges relating to the incident were taken into consideration during sentencing, the report said.
THE INCIDENT
On Jun 14, 2018, Milne met friends for drinks at Boat Quay before heading to another bar at Pan Pacific Singapore hotel where he shared two bottles of vodka with friends, TODAY reported.
At about 1.30am, Milne left the bar to buy water at a convenience store in Marina Square mall, where a group of workers were carrying out cable installation works related to the National Day Parade, the report said.
Milne climbed into the workers' lorry and started throwing equipment around; the workers' supervisor called the police when Milne refused to get out of the vehicle.
The workers also alerted the national servicemen escorting the installation work for help, as Milne had tried to flee while waiting for the police to arrive.
A struggle ensued and Milne fell into a bush and pulled one of the national servicemen along with him, tearing the other man's shirt in the process.
Milne was arrested for causing annoyance in public while drunk, after he gave the police incomplete answers when they asked for his details and address.
MILNE TRIED TO BITE OFFICER'S HAND TWICE: MHA
While in the police car, Milne repeatedly kicked the driver's and front passenger seats where two officers were seated, MHA said.
The ministry added that when the officer seated in the back seat with Milne tried to restrain him, Milne kicked the officer's head and tried to bite his hand. Milne also verbally abused the three officers in the car.
TODAY reported that the officer later sought medical attention at the Singapore General Hospital, where he was found to have swelling, mild tenderness and a 5cm by 5cm bruise on his face.
Court documents listed nine abusive and explicit phrases that Milne had used against the officer while at the back of the car which was captured on a body-worn camera. INITIAL: vc(rw)",Channel NewsAsia,12-05-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999957005043196}",en,0.9999957005043196

The Straits Times (Singapore)
May 13, 2022 Friday","There will be a coroner's hearing next month into the deaths of the five men in the Tanjong Pagar crash that happened last year.
 The hearing will take place on June 9.
 At about 5.40am on Feb 13, the five men were in a white BMW M4 that crashed into a shophouse in Tanjong Pagar.
 The car subsequently burst into flames. All five men died.
 They were Mr Jonathan Long Junwei, 29; Mr Eugene Yap Zheng Min, 29; Mr Elvin Tan Yong Hao, 28; Mr Wilson Teo Qi Xiang, 26; and Mr Gary Wong Hong Chieh, 29.
 Mr Long was the driver.
 All but Mr Wong were financial advisers at Aviva Financial Advisers. Mr Wong was a former representative at the firm.
 In security camera footage of the incident, the car appeared to be travelling at a high speed down Tanjong Pagar Road before the crash.
 It spun out of control before impact, and exploded in a ball of flames shortly after.
 Footage also showed Mr Long's fiancee, Ms Raybe Oh Siew Huey, 26, running into the fire to try to save the victims.
 The former air stewardess and getai performer was then seen emerging from the inferno covered in flames and running towards shophouses across the road.
 She suffered severe burns and was rushed to Singapore General Hospital and admitted to the intensive care unit.
 Her condition stabilised and she was moved to a high-dependency ward just over a week later.
 It is understood that Ms Oh and the others were at a Korean eatery just opposite the site of the crash prior to the accident.
 Ms Oh has spent over a year undergoing dozens of operations.
 In an interview with The Straits Times last year, she said she has been staying strong, with her mother as her pillar of support.
 She added that she had no regrets trying to save her fiance, and is still close to Mr Long's family.
 Following the fatal crash, the Land Transport Authority looked into the road conditions in Tanjong Pagar and subsequently installed more traffic-calming measures such as road dividers and pedestrian crossings.",The Straits Times (Singapore),12-05-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999968353276}",en,0.9999968353276

The Straits Times (Singapore)
May 16, 2022 Monday","Three children were taken to hospital after a fire broke out at a Housing Board flat in Marsiling late on Saturday night.
 The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted to the fire at a 29th-floor unit in Block 180C Marsiling Road at around midnight, and extinguished it with a water jet.
 The victims were taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), and the cause of the fire is under investigation, SCDF added.
 Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC MP Zaqy Mohamad, who visited the children in KKH yesterday, told The Straits Times they are stable and are expected to be discharged today. He said one of them is a seven-year-old girl, and the other two are her cousin and his female friend, who are in secondary school.
 Mr Zaqy added that the children were alone in the flat when the fire started. ST understands the girl's mother got home from work at around the same time that SCDF officers arrived to put out the fire.
 Neighbours that ST spoke to said they did not know much about the family in the affected flat.
 A neighbour on the same floor who wanted to be known only as Madam Zara, 47, said her children were at home when the fire broke out. She and her husband were in Johor Bahru at the time.
 The housewife added: ""We got a text message from one of our neighbours saying there was a fire on our floor. My heart dropped because I just heard about the recent case in Bedok where three people died.""
 Another neighbour living below the affected unit told ST that she woke up at around midnight due to a strong smell of smoke. She immediately woke her daughter and they went outside to the common corridor to see what was happening.
 ""I looked up from the garbage disposal area and could see flames coming from the flat,"" said the waitress who declined to be named.
 Noting that police officers soon arrived to evacuate the block, she added: ""It was a bit of a shock for us to see policemen knocking on all the doors telling us to evacuate.""
 She said residents gathered at the void deck, and they were kept there for about an hour before being allowed to return home.

    MADAM ZARA, a neighbour whose children were at home when the fire broke out. She and her husband were in Johor Bahru at the time.  Mr Zaqy said two town council officers were on site at about 1am after the fire was put out. He said the extent of damage to the flat was not clear as the police have not given clearance to enter the unit.
 The Residents' Network is in touch with the affected family to provide support, he added.
 The family was issued keys to a temporary unit in the block yesterday afternoon.
 The incident follows a spate of fires over the past few days, including one at a flat in Bedok North last Friday morning where three people, including a three-year-old toddler, died.
 SCDF officers arrived at the fourth-floor unit at about 6.40am and took three unconscious people to hospital.

211,"Ex-history teacher from top girls&#039; school jailed for sexually exploiting teenage student, who later committed suicide
Today (Singapore) - Online
May 24, 2022 Tuesday","SINGAPORE - While working as a history teacher in a top girls' school here, a 36-year-old man started a ""relationship"" with a 15-year-old student and committed indecent acts with her in the secondary school. After a few months, he ended the affair and she completed her secondary school education. Three years later, she returned to the school to work as a relief teacher, but the sexual acts came to light another four years later, prompting the principal to make a police report. The victim ended up taking her own life in May last year at the age of 25, several months after the teacher pleaded guilty to two criminal charges of committing an indecent act with a young person under the Children and Young Persons Act. She had been diagnosed with anorexia and major depressive disorder several years earlier. 
On Tuesday (May 24), the Singaporean teacher, now aged 47, was jailed for 15 months. Two other similar charges were taken into consideration for sentencing. He will begin serving his sentence next week and remains out on a S$20,000 bail. He, as well as the school where he taught, cannot be named due to a court order to protect the victim's identity. The teacher left the Ministry of Education in 2018 around the time when his offences were reported. The court previously heard that he has a history of bipolar disorder, but a psychiatrist found that a mandatory treatment order was not suitable for him. This is a community sentencing option offered to offenders suffering from mental conditions that contributed to the offence. Even though the victim in this latest court case has since died, a gag order covering her and the teacher's identities serves to protect her reputation and family members, criminal lawyers told TODAY. Gag orders are imposed by the courts to protect victims, and they usually extend to accused persons' identities if naming them leads to the identification of their victims. These typically involve crimes where sexual violence or children are involved and the gag orders last indefinitely. In this case, a gag order was imposed when the teacher was charged with the offences. His victim committed suicide after he admitted to the offences. Mr Sunil Sudheesan, who heads the Association of Criminal Lawyers of Singapore, said that the victim's family likely wanted privacy for her. He noted that the prosecution sometimes consults victims' families on whether they want a gag order to remain, but ""decides on its own"" on other occasions. Mr Cory Wong, associate director at Invictus Law Corporation, said that what a victim's family thinks cannot supplement what the victim herself would have thought, and that the reasons why she did not ask to lift the gag order will likely remain the same today. ""Or rather, we are not privy to any change in the victim's express wishes. So we have to respect her decisions then, and they continue to extend into her dignity and privacy even in death now,"" Mr Wong added. In this case, publicly holding the accused accountable may be a ""double-edged sword"" and the law should ""always err on the side of caution to protect the victim whether in life or in death, independently of whatever entails for good or for worse for the offender"", the defence counsel noted. Mr Clarence Lun from Fervent Chambers said that even though the victim has already died, it was unlikely that she would want further embarrassment. It will also prevent family members from more public scrutiny and allow them to move on with their lives in due course, Mr Lun added. 'I CAN DO ANYTHING NOW' The accused met the victim in 2009, the same year he was posted to the school as a history teacher. In August 2010, they spent more time together because she was the student head of a co-curricular activity that he was in charge of as well. He also taught an advanced history class that she attended. During this time, they began talking about personal matters with each other over coffee and through text messages on the phone. In December that year, the man went to London in England for a holiday but they stayed in contact, saying that they missed each other. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Asoka Markandu told the court that the girl understood from their conversations that he wanted her to treat him like a partner. When they returned for the new academic year in January 2011, they began to meet more frequently in school, depending on each other for their emotional needs. By end-February 2011, they were in a ""relationship"" and held hands when alone in school. As part of their co-curricular duties, they and other committee members were given access cards to a room. The victim and the accused would work and study there when student activities were over. Between March and May 2011, the pair were alone in the room when he grabbed her wrists, lifted them above her head and pressed her against the wall. He told her ""I can do anything now"" before letting go of her wrists after several seconds. The victim recalled feeling confused and embarrassed by his actions but did not react or say anything, DPP Markandu told the court. Around the same period, they were alone in the room again when he groped her private parts under her underwear. Taken by surprise and not knowing how to react, she did not say anything and stepped away when he removed his hand. The pair continued to communicate and met during the June holidays in 2011. When the new term started, he told her that their relationship was over and did not make more advances towards her. They stayed in touch when she left the school. In January 2014, she returned to the school as a relief teacher to teach history for six months - and he was involved in this arrangement. During this period, she began showing signs of an eating disorder. The man accompanied her to Singapore General Hospital where she was referred for treatment. She stopped contacting him in November 2016 on her psychiatrist's advice. About two years later, she told a friend about what had happened between her and the accused. The matter escalated to the principal who filed a police report on the victim's behalf. DPP Ng Jean Ting, who sought at least 12 months' jail, revealed in court what the victim went through in more details. DPP Ng said that after the man broke up with the victim, she developed suicidal thoughts, feeling like he had ""broken her"" and she should ""disappear and not exist"". Her weight fluctuated significantly due to her eating disorder and she could not concentrate in school. In 2014, she was formally diagnosed with anorexia and major depressive disorder. She attempted suicide thrice that year and was warded in hospital for 10 days before being referred to a psychiatrist. In 2016, she told her psychiatrist that she was distressed about her relationship with the man. She followed her psychiatrist's advice to stop communicating with him. However, this triggered her suicidal thoughts once more. She was warded again for four weeks in October 2017 for electroconvulsive therapy. She then tragically took her own life in May last year, DPP Ng said. As for the man's bipolar disorder, another psychiatrist found that the mental illness did not have a contributory link to his offences, and he clearly knew what he was doing given that he made his advances only when they were alone in the room. Bipolar disorder is characterised by severe mood changes and individuals experience repeated episodes of depression and mania. For each charge of committing an indecent act, he could have been jailed for up to five years or fined up to S$10,000, or punished with both. CORRECTION: In an earlier version of this story, we reported that the victim took her own life before the teacher pleaded guilty. This is incorrect. She committed suicide after the teacher pleaded guilty. We are sorry for the error.",Today (Singapore) - Online,25-05-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999975325015014}",en,0.9999975325015014
212,"Coping with colorectal cancer; It is the top cancer among men, but many are diagnosed only at later stages of the disease
The Straits Times (Singapore)
May 25, 2022 Wednesday","Film director Desmond Tan found out he had stage 4 colorectal cancer three years ago. The cancer had spread from his colon to his liver and surrounding lymph nodes.
 He started to feel severe and sharp pain in his lower abdomen, and had blood in his stools a few months before he was diagnosed.
 He was also unable to pass motion properly despite going to the toilet five to six times a day, says the 47-year-old, who is married and has two sons aged four and six.
 ""The feeling was like knives digging into my intestines: sharp and non-stop. I would often break out in cold sweat and had to stop myself from screaming,"" he says.
 Colorectal cancer is the cancer of the colon (large intestine) and the rectum, which is the passageway connecting the colon to the anus.
 It is the most common cancer among men and the second most common cancer among women in Singapore after breast cancer.
 The number of people diagnosed with colorectal cancer here has increased over the years, according to figures from the Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Report 2014 and 2019. Cases among men went up from 5,101 over 2010 to 2014 to 6,436 over 2015 to 2019. Among women, cases increased from 4,219 to 5,253 over the same period.
 Two of three hospitals and clinics that The Straits Times checked with saw a rise in colorectal cancer cases last year.
 Dr Wong Seng Weng, medical director and consultant medical oncologist at Singapore Medical Group's The Cancer Centre, treated 20 to 30 per cent more colorectal cancer patients last year, compared with 2019.
 Similarly, Singapore General Hospital (SGH) has seen a 20 per cent rise in cases last year from 2020.
 Dr Isaac Seow-En, a consultant at its department of colorectal surgery, says many patients chose to reschedule their appointments to avoid the hospital in 2020 during the pandemic.
 He notes that despite national colorectal cancer screening programmes, about 60 per cent of cases are diagnosed at later stages, citing findings from the Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Report 2019.
 Colorectal cancer usually starts with growths of tissue called polyps on the inner lining of the colon or rectum, which may develop into cancer over time.
 Polyps, Dr Seow-En explains, often do not cause symptoms, and those with stage 1 or 2 colorectal cancer may feel well.
 People with stage 3 and 4 cancers are far more likely to have symptoms including blood in the stools, changes to bowel habits, abdominal discomfort or pain, and loss of weight or appetite.
 In some cases, however, patients with late-stage cancer may not exhibit symptoms.
 Dr Quah Hak Mien, a consultant colorectal and general surgeon at Gleneagles Hospital, recently saw a businessman in his mid-50s for late-stage colorectal cancer.
 ""He was very shocked when he heard the report because he felt well and had no symptoms,"" says Dr Quah.
 Colorectal cancer is preventable, doctors stress. One of the main ways to do so is through screening for those aged 50 and above.
 The assessment for colorectal cancer starts with a thorough history taking and physical examination by a doctor.
 Dr Seow-En explains that faecal collection kits look for microscopic blood in the stool, which may suggest colorectal polyps or cancer.
 ""While stool tests are noninvasive and safe for patients, they are not 100 per cent accurate, and if positive, patients are usually referred to a specialist for further confirmatory tests,"" he says.
 Of these, the most common test performed is a colonoscopy, which can detect polyps that are potentially pre-cancerous.
 Dr Seow-En says it may take as long as 10 years for a small polyp to develop into cancer, hence the removal of the polyp during this period can prevent cancer from developing.
 ""As a colorectal surgeon, I have removed several thousand polyps from patients, and I would like to think that many cancers have been prevented in this way,"" he adds.
 Early detection is important in increasing the success of treatment. Patients treated at stage 1 or 2 have a greater than 80 or 90 per cent chance of surviving more than five years after their treatment, notes Dr Seow-En.
 For Mr Tan, who directs commercials, treatment started with four cycles of chemotherapy before surgery to remove 30cm of colon and surrounding lymph nodes, as well as 3.5cm of the tumour. He then went for another four cycles of chemotherapy.
 Unfortunately, almost nine months after his diagnosis, scans showed that the cancer had progressed and metastasised to the peritoneum, the thin membrane surrounding the abdominal organs.
 Mr Tan had to undergo chemotherapy and surgery again to treat the cancer.
 In October 2020, he was declared to be in remission when a check-up showed no evidence of the disease.
 Mr Tan says his 42-year-old wife has been his main pillar of support: ""It was her strength that kept me alive and kicking. Even though she was holding down a full-time job and looking after our two boys, she still had to worry and think about me.""
 He used to eat a lot of fast food and instant noodles, but now stays away from processed food and consumes more vegetables, tofu and beans.
 Mr Tan has also become an advocate for early cancer screening.
 He says: ""Colorectal cancer does not creep up suddenly. It takes a long time to develop and is a cancer that can be arrested early. I wish that I had gone for a screening much earlier. Who knows, a few months earlier and it might not have been stage 4'""
    SYMPTOMS  The feeling was like knives digging into my intestines: sharp and non-stop. I would often break out in cold sweat and had to stop myself from screaming.
    FILM DIRECTOR DESMOND TAN,   who had stage 4 colorectal cancer    SOMETIMES NO SYMPTOMS  He was very shocked when he heard the report because he felt well and had no symptoms.
    DR QUAH HAK MIEN   on a businessman in his mid-50s whom he saw for late-stage colorectal cancer     How to prevent colorectal cancer While colorectal cancer can strike at any age, it mostly occurs after the age of 50 and people of Chinese ethnicity have a higher risk of getting the disease.
 People with a family history of colorectal cancer or polyps, which are non-cancerous growths of tissue, may also be at a higher risk.
 Although these are factors that cannot be controlled, doctors say there are lifestyle and dietary choices that people can make to help prevent colorectal cancer.
 This includes maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, says Dr Quah Hak Mien, a consultant colorectal and general surgeon at Gleneagles Hospital.
 ""We should maintain a balanced diet that has lots of vegetables and fruit and whole grains, and reduce the consumption of red meat and processed meat. Eating meat cooked at very high temperatures, like grilled meat, might also increase one's cancer risk,"" adds Dr Quah.
 Many people in Singapore are not doing tests that can help detect colorectal cancer early, doctors say.
 Citing findings from the Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Report 2019, Dr Isaac Seow-En, a consultant at Singapore General Hospital's department of colorectal surgery, says that despite national colorectal cancer screening programmes, about 60 per cent of cases are diagnosed at later stages of the disease.
 People aged 50 and above are advised to go for a colonoscopy, where a long flexible tube is inserted into the large intestine to check for tumours. If nothing worrying is found, a subsequent colonoscopy is necessary only 10 years later, says Dr Seow-En.
 Another way to screen for colorectal cancer is through a stool test called the Faecal Immunochemical Test, which is offered free of charge by the Singapore Cancer Society. It can detect small amounts of blood in the stool which are usually invisible to the naked eye.
 Those who are above age 50 and have no symptoms of colorectal cancer can do this test once a year as an alternative to a colonoscopy.
 Says Dr Quah: ""Early detection of colorectal cancer improves the chances of successful treatment and long-term cure.""

213,"Hot in the city
The Straits Times (Singapore)
May 26, 2022 Thursday","Doctors see more patients with ailments like heat rash, eczemaYoung kids, elderly at higher risk of heat-related complications
With the weeks-long sweltering heat persisting for the rest of the month and drier weather expected to stay till September, doctors have cautioned the public about heat-related health risks.
 During the hotter months, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital sees up to three times more patients with heat-related injuries than in the cooler months, said Dr Kanak Naidu, senior consultant at the hospital's department of acute and emergency care.
 They range from mild conditions such as heat rash, heat cramps - painful muscle spasms due to dehydration and overworked muscles - and heat exhaustion, to more severe forms like heatstroke.
 Dr Derek Li, a family physician at Raffles Medical, has seen more patients with flare-ups of skin ailments such as eczema and hives, which can be triggered by heat and dehydration from sweating.
 He added that people who work outdoors are more prone to headaches, body aches, dizzy spells and poor concentration.
 ""But these symptoms are difficult to attribute purely to heat stress alone... (with) the background incidence of Covid-19 and dengue fever in the community, all of which can also cause similar symptoms.""
 He expects the number of heat-related complications to rise in the next few weeks, with more large-scale sporting events resuming.
 The National University Polyclinics and the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP) have been seeing more patients with mild conditions such as heat rashes and eczema flare-ups.
 Family physician Yeap Youwen from Hougang Polyclinic, which is under NHGP, said the polyclinics have been seeing patients with heat rash and heat cramps daily.
 Dr Lee Joon Loong, medical director of Paddington Medical Clinic, said the warm and dry weather is a double whammy for patients with gastroenteritis who are predisposed to dehydration.
 Last month and this month have seen some of the highest temperatures recorded in Singapore.
 April 1 saw the second-highest temperature on record here, at 36.8 deg C in Admiralty. May 13 was the hottest May day on record at 36.7 deg C, also in Admiralty.
      Avoid heat stress Â·Go for loose-fitting, thin and absorbent clothing and a hat.
 Â·Avoid intense outdoor activities between 10am and 4pm.
 Â·Drink at least two litres of water a day. People with medical conditions should check their fluid requirements with their doctors.
 Â·For those who are not used to the heat, they have to gradually increase their heat tolerance by slowly raising the intensity or duration of work performed under the sun.
 Â·Avoid strenuous exercise if you are unwell.
 Â·Outdoor workers should take periodic breaks in a shaded area. Handheld portable fans can be used to cool the body down as you perspire.
 Â·Iced slushies, but only of the non-sugary kind, can help. Drinks high in sugar and alcohol content should be avoided.
 Â·Do more aerobic fitness exercises to train the heart to pump blood more efficiently and raise one's thermal tolerance.
 Â·Moisturise skin to manage heat rashes and eczema. Topical steroids of appropriate potency and oral antihistamines may help with eczema flare-ups.

    A climate report card released last week by the World Meteorological Organisation stated that 2021 was between the fifth and seventh hottest years on record, despite last year's La Nina climate phenomenon, which causes a temporary cooling in the Pacific.
 Dr Rachel Lim, SingHealth Polyclinics' clinical lead for its preventive care workgroup, said young children, who tend to perspire less, and the elderly, whose ability to remove heat from their body has dropped, are at more risk of heat-related complications.
 Other groups at risk include those who are obese, patients with chronic conditions, heavy alcohol drinkers and foreigners not used to the local weather.
 ""Perspiration is a common method of heat removal for the body. However, this method becomes less effective in a humid environment like Singapore's,"" noted Dr Lim.
 Dr Ang Shiang Hu, chief of Changi General Hospital's accident and emergency department, said exertional heat injuries - caused by a rise in body temperature due to intense physical activity - are more common here, compared with classic heat injuries in heatwaves in temperate regions.
 Even so, the elderly, especially those with chronic diseases and who live in less ventilated conditions, are more susceptible to classic heat illnesses, doctors said.
 Seniors with cardiovascular disease, for example, can collapse from heat stress due to oxygen deprivation to internal organs.
 So it is important to keep a close watch on the bed-bound or those unable to communicate, said Associate Professor Kenneth Tan, head of Singapore General Hospital's department of emergency medicine.
 These days, Dr Lee's parting words to his patients are: ""Drink lots of water.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),25-05-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999977009805001}",en,0.9999977009805001

The Straits Times (Singapore)
May 29, 2022 Sunday","She remembered her shock turning instantly into panic and horror when she realised her hand was trapped in the mincer, and a split second later came the kind of pain she never imagined existed as her fingers were crushed.
 When Ms Rabiah Baharuddin Abdul came to in a hospital bed hours later after surgery, she knew almost immediately she had lost the five fingers on her right hand, and her life had changed forever.
 Recalling the fateful moment in 2019, the Indonesian national broke down when she spoke to The Sunday Times last week, saying: ""I remember looking at a heavily bandaged right hand, and all I could think was how am I going to support my children now'
 ""I left Indonesia and came to Singapore to support my children and give them a good life.
 ""How can I do that now'""
 Ms Rabiah, who is from Makassar, Indonesia, came to Singapore to work as a domestic helper in 2018.
 While she was hired by Affendi B. Husain to do household chores, she was made to work illegally at his wife's bakery.
 The couple appeared in court on May 20 and Affendi, 61, was fined $8,700, while bakery owner Mastura Abdul Khalil, 46, was sentenced to four weeks' jail and fined $10,400.
 Ms Rabiah, who returned to Singapore in early May for the court case, bears no ill will against them.
 ""I've forgiven them, because I know they never wanted this to happen. When I heard that my employer's wife will be facing jail time, I was sad because I know they have children.
 ""This means she'll be away from them during that time. I feel for them,"" she said.
 Now 37, Ms Rabiah spoke to ST with the help of an interpreter at the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) headquarters at Pasir Panjang.
 She was shy about her right hand, and only allowed it to be shown covered by her traditional Muslim dress.
 She had started working for the couple on Oct 27, 2018, and was at the bakery several days a week. When it got busy, she would work there every day.
 On the day of the accident, on June 6, 2019, she was tasked to open around 144 sardine cans and process the fish in an electric mincer.
 Wearing a latex glove, Ms Rabiah, who said she had been taught how to use the mincer only once, loaded the sardines into the machine with her right hand.
 After a few minutes, the glove became loose and got caught in the mincing component, and she was unable to pull her hand out.
 The fingers on her dominant hand quickly became mangled in the machine and she couldn't believe the intensity of the pain.
 ""Everything happened very quickly. At first, I didn't feel the pain. My mind was still trying to understand what had happened.
 ""Suddenly, the pain came and it was so intense. I couldn't pull my hand out and I started screaming,"" Ms Rabiah recalled, visibly emotional.
 Her screams for help drew the attention of Mastura's children, who were at the bakery, and one of them called their mother.
 The husband and wife, who were at a funeral, arrived about half an hour later and called an ambulance.
 During all that time, Ms Rabiah remained conscious despite the searing pain.
 She was still conscious when taken to Changi General Hospital with her hand still attached to part of the mincer.
 Due to the extent of her injury, she was transferred quickly to Singapore General Hospital (SGH), where doctors performed three surgeries on her.
 ""When I woke up after the third surgery, I looked down and realised I had lost all my fingers on my right hand,"" said Ms Rabiah, who was hospitalised for 20 days in SGH.
 ""Throughout my stay in hospital, all I could think about was my children and what I could do to support them.
 ""I just felt so stressed and sad and I couldn't sleep,"" she added, with tears rolling down her cheeks.
 Ms Rabiah, a single mum, has two daughters and a son, aged between 10 and 17.
 Her son was just six when she left Indonesia to work here in 2018.
 She said: ""It was so hard to leave my children behind and come to Singapore. But I knew I had a responsibility to provide for them and give them a good life.
 ""I had only worked for less than a year and this happened to me.""
 In the weeks following her discharge, Ms Rabiah struggled with basic daily activities like brushing her teeth and putting on clothes.
 But determined to bounce back for her children, she started taking English lessons and cooking courses offered by the CDE.
 When she returned home to Makassar in March last year, she used some of the money she received as compensation and started a business selling mobile phones and other electrical appliances such as washing machines.
 Last month, she opened a bubble tea shop and her eldest daughter helps out there. Both businesses are doing well, she said.
 Now that the case has been heard, she just wants to move on and provide for her three schoolgoing children.
 She said: ""Before the trial, I kept thinking about the case. But now, I see it as a closed chapter. All this time, my children have been the source of my strength.
 ""I know I can get through anything and I'm happy to be alive.""
    HARBOURING NO ILL WILL  I've forgiven them, because I know they never wanted this to happen. When I heard that my employer's wife will be facing jail time, I was sad because I know they have children. This means she'll be away from them during that time. I feel for them.

Today (Singapore) - Online
June 9, 2022 Thursday","SINGAPORE - The collab we didn't know we needed just happened. Health Minister Ong Ye Kung had ""a special guest"" in his TikTok video posted on Thursday (June 9) - TikTok sensation Uncle Raymond, who publishes his content under the username ""raymondl88"". Uncle Raymond shot to fame from posting wholesome short TikTok videos of himself dancing to catchy tunes. He has close to 50,000 followers on TikTok as of Thursday, a figure almost similar to Mr Ong's 53,000 followers. 
The pair danced to Uncle Raymond's signature tune, Hong Kong singer Faye Wong's song Hundred Years of Solitude, at the Singapore General Hospital alongside some healthcare workers. Starting off with a fist pump to the sky, Uncle Raymond led the team through the morning exercise. The video, posted on Mr Ong's TikTok account, has 215,000 views and 18,500 ""likes"" in just four hours. On Uncle Raymond's TikTok, he thanked Minister Ong for inviting him to take part in the video. ""Thanks for meeting. Be happy,"" Uncle Raymond commented on his own post of their dance video. ""He's a beautiful dancer,"" he added in a comment describing Mr Ong. Online users are in a tizzy over the partnership, calling it the ""best collab with minister"", with some speculating that Uncle Raymond will be ""in NDP (National Day Parade) this year"". Uncle Raymond, who hails from China, gained internet fame from a humble start - he dances solo here in front of MRT stations, bus stops and even the Merlion. After finding his niche in making snappy 10-second videos with simple dance moves, he has since stuck to his formula. Perhaps it is the simplicity of Uncle Raymond's videos that draws in viewers. His infectious energy and groovy moves have clearly won over the internet crowd.

216,"Drink-driver was speeding at up to 148kmh before crash; Jonathan Long was fourth person at wheel and his blood alcohol level busted legal limit, coroner's inquiry told
The Straits Times (Singapore)
June 10, 2022 Friday","The coroner's inquiry into the deaths of five men who were in a fiery car crash in Tanjong Pagar on Feb 13 last year heard that the white BMW M4 had hit speeds of up to 181kmh.
 The speed limit for the stretch along Tanjong Pagar Road is 50kmh, Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Firdaus Suleiman testified yesterday before State Coroner Adam Nakhoda.
 The Traffic Police investigator added that 29-year-old Jonathan Long Junwei was the driver when the accident occurred. Mr Long clocked speeds of up to 148kmh while driving around the Tanjong Pagar area.
 Senior Staff Sgt Firdaus said that at about 5.40am, the car crashed into a pillar at a shophouse and burst into flames.
 He added that an autopsy showed that Mr Long had a blood alcohol reading of 86mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. This exceeded the legal limit of 80mg per 100ml.
 Mr Long and his four passengers - Mr Wilson Teo Qi Xiang, 26; Mr Elvin Tan Yong Hao, 28; Mr Eugene Yap Zheng Min, 29; and Mr Gary Wong Hong Chieh, 29 - were killed in the incident.
 Senior Staff Sgt Firdaus told the court that shortly before the tragedy, Mr Long and his friends were at a Chinese New Year gathering in Ang Mo Kio where they consumed alcoholic drinks.
 They then left for Hong Jja Jang restaurant in Tanjong Pagar Road, where they continued drinking.
 The eatery was run by Mr Park Se Jin. Senior Staff Sgt Firdaus said that according to witnesses, Mr Long later decided to show his newly purchased BMW to his friends. The group took turns at the wheel, each driving once around the Tanjong Pagar area.
 Mr Yap, who was later found to have 119mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, was the first to take the car for a ride that morning.
 Mr Park and another friend, Ms Phoo Yi Lin, joined him in the car. Mr Yap drove from the Tanjong Pagar restaurant towards Keppel, and made a U-turn in Enggor Street.
 After that, he drove the car along Tanjong Pagar Road towards Maxwell Road before stopping near the eatery. Mr Yap had driven the car at speeds of between 75kmh and 88kmh.
 Mr Park then took the wheel, with Ms Phoo as the passenger.
 He also followed the same path, clocking speeds of between 109kmh and 130kmh.
 This was ascertained from closed-circuit television camera footage in the area.
 But dashcam footage taken from a taxi in the area suggested that Mr Park might have hit speeds of up to 181kmh, said Senior Staff Sgt Firdaus.
 Ms Phoo then took over and followed the same route. Mr Park and Mr Yap were in the car with her. She drove at speeds of up to 59kmh.
 Mr Long was the fourth driver and four of his friends - Mr Teo, Mr Tan, Mr Yap and Mr Wong - joined him in the vehicle.
 They did so even though the car had designated seats for only the driver and three passengers.
 He was speeding along Tanjong Pagar Road when the car skidded and mounted a kerb.
 It struck a pillar at an estimated speed of between 87kmh and 99kmh, resulting in the fatal crash.
 After the accident, Mr Long's fiancee, former air stewardess Raybe Oh Siew Huey, 26, rushed to the scene to try to help the occupants and was badly burned in the incident.
 She spent four months in the Singapore General Hospital.
 Senior Staff Sgt Firdaus testified that Mr Long, Mr Yap and Mr Tan died from severe burns.
 Mr Teo died from severe burns and a spinal injury, while Mr Wong died from severe burns and pelvic injuries.

217,"Ka-Soh flagship to close after 20 years
The Straits Times (Singapore)
June 11, 2022 Saturday","After 20 years in Outram, the flagship Ka-Soh restaurant will close on June 26.
 The brand is best known for its traditional Cantonese-style fish soup with a rich, milky broth achieved by hours of boiling.
 This outlet - located at the Alumni Medical Centre at Singapore General Hospital - has been a recipient of the Michelin Guide's Bib Gourmand accolade since 2016.
 The last remaining Ka-Soh outlet in Greenwood Avenue, which opened 2Â½ years ago, remains in business.
 Its sister eatery, Swee Kee Eating House in Amoy Street, shut in May last year.
 It was one of the many food-and-beverage victims of the pandemic, as business was hit hard with its Central Business District diners working from home.
 Since announcing the flagship's closure, the outlet has been a ""mad house"" with diners, says Mr Cedric Tang, 37, third-generation owner of Ka-Soh.
 However, manpower issues - compounded by rising costs of food and logistics - have made it extremely challenging to carry on.
 After his father died in March, some staff have retired, while others have returned to Malaysia and China.
 Hiring new staff would require paying for their work permits and lodging, Mr Tang says, which would have ""ripple effects"" on other expenses.
 To manage, he has had to jump in to work in the kitchen, while his elder brother Gareth - who handles finance and administrative matters - has to help with service.
 After the Outram outlet closes, Mr Tang will readjust the menu at Greenwood. It will be streamlined to focus on key dishes and he will also add dishes that customers in the area have been requesting.
 These include his popular pork lard fried rice and new crayfish items - which were initially planned for Outram.
 By focusing on one outlet, he hopes to improve business on weekdays and take his team out to participate in guest chef events.
 He does not rule out expanding again, but deems it unlikely amid the manpower crunch.
 He adds: ""There's a difference between closing Swee Kee and Ka-Soh. Swee Kee was part of my childhood memories growing up, but for Ka-Soh, it took 15 years to build up the business.
 ""A lot of effort was thrown into the business, so it hurts differently.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),10-06-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999952295472245}",en,0.9999952295472245
218,"$25m grant to find best ways to treat liver cancer
The Straits Times (Singapore)
June 14, 2022 Tuesday","Singapore is dedicating $25 million to liver cancer research in a new five-year programme led by the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) that aims to find the best treatments for the disease.
 The team, comprising researchers from various institutions, will work to uncover biomarkers produced by the body or tumour so that specific therapies can be created to combat the most common type of liver cancer, known as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
 The research programme and the $25 million grant for it were announced in a media briefing yesterday.
 The research aims to bring about more effective tailored treatments for liver cancer patients, said Professor Pierce Chow, senior consultant at Singapore General Hospital and NCCS' division of surgery and surgical oncology, who is leading the programme.
 Earlier this month, the Ministry of Health's National Medical Research Council awarded the $25 million grant to the researchers, who are from NCCS, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's Genome Institute of Singapore and Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore and Duke-NUS Medical School.
 In Singapore, liver cancer is the third most common cause of cancer deaths in men and the fifth most common one in women.
 It is difficult to diagnose the disease at early stages because the liver is an internal organ and once symptoms emerge, the cancer has already advanced, said Prof Chow. After removing the tumour in early-stage patients, there are no available therapies to prevent the tumour from returning.
 He said: ""This inability to prevent the tumour from coming back even when diagnosed early (and with surgery) is the reason why the survival of patients with early liver cancer is not as good as those with early-stage breast, colorectal or lung cancer.""
 The programme, called Precision Medicine In Liver Cancer Across An Asia-Pacific Network (PLANet 2.0), will involve two clinical studies.
 In the first one, at least 30 liver cancer patients will undergo immunotherapy after surgery to reduce the chance of the tumour returning.
 Immunotherapy is a type of biological therapy, mainly given intravenously and orally, that helps the immune system fight cancer better.
 The second study will involve 176 intermediate-and advanced-stage liver cancer patients who will receive internal radiation therapy. Half of them will receive a type of immuno-therapy while the rest will be placed in a placebo group. This will help researchers determine if patients do better with a combination of the novel radiation therapy and immunotherapy.
 The researchers will take scans and collect blood and urine samples before, during and after the clinical studies.
 The two clinical studies will take place concurrently at public hospitals and cancer institutions here, as well as 11 hospitals in the Asia-Pacific region. Some patients will start treatment from next month.",The Straits Times (Singapore),13-06-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999956630797974}",en,0.9999956630797974
219,"Ready for next wave: Public hospitals prepared to set aside more beds for Covid-19 patients, no plans to freeze leave
Today (Singapore) - Online
June 15, 2022 Wednesday","SINGAPORE - Public hospitals here are gearing up for the fifth wave of Covid-19, which is expected to hit Singapore as early as July, by setting aside enough manpower and beds for an influx of patients. However, there are no plans yet to freeze leave for healthcare workers, because the hospitals said that they are prepared to adapt their manpower needs to the situation. This is corroborated by six public hospital staff members who spoke to TODAY, saying that they have not been subjected to new leave protocols in preparation for the expected wave. Infectious disease experts also said that there is no need to be extremely concerned about the upcoming wave as long as people are vaccinated and practise good hygiene. 
On June 2, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that Singapore should prepare for another wave of Covid-19 cases in July or August, noting that South Africa is riding its fifth Covid-19 wave, driven by the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 virus variants. On May 15, the Ministry of Health said that it had detected two Covid-19 cases here with the BA.4 variant, and one case of the BA.5 variant. Mr Ong said: ""We feel BA.4 and BA.5, this is a wave we can ride through. But don't be complacent, still be prepared for it."" PREPARED TO SET ASIDE MORE BEDS, MANPOWER Professor Fong Kok Yong, SingHealth's deputy group chief executive officer of medical and clinical services, said that the hospital group is ""well-prepared to increase our capacity to care for Covid-19 patients as necessary... and we will proactively respond as and when the need arises"". ""We take guidance from the Ministry of Health, aligning our strategies and keeping a close watch on the situation so as to anticipate new needs (and) challenges, and respond quickly as we have done before."" Prof Fong, who is also the co-chair of the SingHealth Disease Outbreak Taskforce, said that this includes reconfiguring existing wards to care for Covid-19 patients, and using statistics from historical data to predict and optimise their hospitals' capacities. Hospitals under SingHealth include Singapore General Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital and Changi General Hospital. When asked about freezing leave, Prof Fong said that there have not been any changes to existing policies. ""When approving their staff's leave, supervisors take into consideration the need for adequate staffing for business-as-usual healthcare services as well as buffer sufficient manpower reserves to accommodate any surge in Covid-19 cases, while keeping in view a balanced rotation of staff in the department."" The SingHealth cluster includes Singapore General Hospital, Changi General Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital and KK Women's and Children's Hospital. Associate Professor Thomas Loh, group chairman of the medical board at National University Health System (NUHS), said that the NUHS group is ""prepared and equipped to handle a potential surge in Covid-19 cases"". He added that hospitals under NUHS - namely the National University Hospital, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital and Alexandra Hospital - are closely monitoring the situation and will adjust their responses accordingly. ""We will do our best to optimise resources for both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients and will continue to remain vigilant and maintain sufficient capacity in our inpatient facilities, including our intensive care and isolation facilities."" NUHS has set aside existing beds that can be converted into isolation beds for Covid-19 cases. It has also set aside more holding facilities for suspected Covid-19 cases while awaiting their test results, Assoc Prof Loh said. ""We are also offering alternative arrangements where clinically appropriate, including tele-consultation, tele-rehabilitation, tele-monitoring, remote prescribing, and delivery of medication,"" he added. TODAY understands from three hospital staff members under NUHS that they have not had their leave frozen. They declined to be named as they have not been authorised to speak to media. A nurse from Sengkang General Hospital said: ""We're up to date with our (vaccines) or have been infected previously, so we'll be all right... but hopefully, this wave won't be as bad as the previous waves."" TODAY has also contacted the National Healthcare Group, which oversees Tan Tock Seng Hospital and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, for comments. 'LIKELY TO BE LESS SERIOUS' THAN PREVIOUS COVID-19 WAVES Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that only two groups of people need to be highly concerned about the possible upcoming Covid-19 wave - those in the healthcare system and the vulnerable such as elders and those who have not been vaccinated. He noted that with Singapore seeing a spike in dengue cases this year, hospitals may see a compounded impact in the rise in hospital admissions. ""The vast majority of those getting Covid-19 during a wave caused by the BA.4 or 5 sub-variants will experience it as a bad cold or flu,"" Assoc Prof Cook said. ""(The possible wave) is likely to be less serious than the previous Omicron wave or the Delta wave of last year. ""In particular, in comparison with the Omicron wave, which did not overwhelm the healthcare system, but put pressure on it, we would expect a smaller wave next time because there is more immunity in the population."" Adding that based on the experiences of other countries that have experienced a BA.5 wave, Assoc Prof Cook said that Singapore would likely not need to tighten any infection controls. Similarly, Professor Tikki Elka Pangestu, a visiting professor at the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, said that people need not be worried if they have been vaccinated. ""Evidence from other countries so far indicates that (the BA.4 and BA.5 strains) cause only mild disease,"" he said. Both Prof Tikki and Assoc Prof Cook called for people who are vulnerable and in the healthcare system to receive a vaccine booster shot, should they meet the Ministry of Health's criteria.",Today (Singapore) - Online,17-06-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999945133193149}",en,0.9999945133193149
220,"Two people taken to hospital after fire in Ang Mo Kio flat; About 50 people evacuated as precautionary measure; cause of early morning blaze under probe
The Straits Times (Singapore)
June 15, 2022 Wednesday","Residents of Block 333 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1 were roused from their sleep yesterday by an early morning blaze at an 11th-floor unit that saw neighbours evacuated and two people taken to hospital.
 Mr Alex Khaw Wee Peng, 40, was fast asleep when he heard someone banging on his front door at 4.45am. It was his next-door neighbour shouting that her three-room flat was on fire.
 When he saw smoke coming out of the unit, he grabbed a pail of water to douse the flames he saw in the neighbour's master bedroom.
 ""I tried to put it out but couldn't as the flames were too strong. I felt it was safer to evacuate,"" said Mr Khaw, who runs a delivery business.
 He rescued a dog from the unit before helping his wife evacuate their neighbours to the ground floor of the block.
 All this happened before Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) firefighters arrived at the scene.
 The occupant of the affected unit, whom neighbours say is a woman in her 40s who lives alone, had to be taken to Singapore General Hospital.
 Meanwhile, another neighbour who collapsed during the blaze was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Mr Khaw said the woman was able to save one of her pet rabbits from the burning flat. Three others died.
 ""She pleaded with my wife and me to save her rabbits but the fire was growing too quickly. It was more important to help our neighbours evacuate,"" said Mr Khaw.
 SCDF said it was alerted to the fire at around 5am, adding that around 50 people were evacuated as a precautionary measure.
 The cause of the fire is under investigation, it added.
 ""Firefighters from Bishan Fire Station extinguished the flames using a water jet and two compressed air foam backpacks,"" said SCDF.
 Mr Syed Syazwan Syed Sulaiman, 25, who lives on the 11th floor, said he was asleep when he heard neighbours screaming and knocking on doors.
 ""When I looked outside, the entire corridor was filled with black smoke and bright orange flames were spilling out of my neighbour's home,"" he said.
 Mr Syazwan, who is an IT technician, added that he heard loud ""bangs"" from the unit before police arrived.
 The officers helped his mother, who is in her 50s, and his sister, 19, down the stairs using flashlights.
 ""I was scared for my family because my mum is not well. But we remained calm and focused on getting out,"" he said.
 Another neighbour who wanted to be known only as Mr Liang said this is the first flat fire in the 40 years he has lived there.
 The 69-year-old, who lives on the same floor, had also attempted to put out the fire using a pail of water.
 ""We neighbours helped one another and luckily no one is seriously injured,"" he said.

221,"Elderly at higher risk of severe illness from dengue: NCID head
The Straits Times (Singapore)
June 16, 2022 Thursday","More attention must be paid to seniors with dengue as they are at a higher risk of severe illness and death, Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of Singapore's National Centre for Infectious Diseases(NCID), said yesterday.
 She was speaking at the fifth Asia Dengue Summit, a three-day event organised by the Asia Dengue Voice and Action group which ended yesterday at Orchard Hotel.
 Citing studies from Singapore's Environmental Health Institute at the National Environment Agency, Prof Leo noted that at least 30 per cent of those aged 60 and above here have never had a dengue infection before.
 Recovery from infection by one dengue virus provides lifelong immunity against that particular virus serotype.
 ""So you can see there's a huge population at risk in Singapore, that's very susceptible to dengue,"" said Prof Leo.
 She added that it is also harder to diagnose an older person with dengue. Citing a study from Taiwan, Prof Leo pointed out that fewer older dengue patients show symptoms of the disease, such as fever, aches and pain as well as rashes.
 Despite this, elderly people tend to be at a higher risk of needing admission to the intensive care unit for dengue, and have more co-morbidities such as hypertension and renal failure.
 Elderly dengue patients also have a higher death rate, said Prof Leo, adding that their age means they are less likely to be able to withstand the toll dengue takes on them.
 ""We really need to look very hard at how we can better manage older (people with dengue),"" she said.
 Another speaker at the summit, Dr Shirin Kalimuddin, who is a senior consultant at the Department of Infectious Diseases in Singapore General Hospital, spoke about the potential long-term effects of dengue infection on patients.
 Noting that there have not been many studies on post-dengue chronic sequelae - the persistence of symptoms more than three months after infection - Dr Kalimuddin, who is also an assistant professor at Duke-NUS Medical School, said that the burden of the disease may be underestimated.
 In a study, which is still under review, Dr Kalimuddin and other researchers examined about 200 patients, about a quarter of whom had dengue infection.
 They found that about three months later, some 18 per cent of them continued to report symptoms, including fatigue, headaches and impaired memory and concentration.
 They also reported functional impairment and a lower health-related quality of life.
 Acknowledging that her research was done with a small sample size and other limitations, Dr Kalimuddin said that it nevertheless raised some important questions, including whether vaccines and therapeutics could be tailored towards addressing not just acute dengue, but its chronic symptoms as well.
 A third speaker at the summit, Associate Professor Somia Iqtadar from King Edward Medical University in Pakistan, warned that dengue infection during pregnancy is associated with higher maternal and perinatal mortality rates.
 ""There is a constellation of different problems which we can encounter if we have dengue in a pregnant female,"" said Prof Somia, citing increased chances of preterm labour, foetal distress and miscarriages as examples.
 She said: ""We need admission and timely disease management (for) infected pregnant women, because this is of utmost importance to save the life of the mother and the foetus.""

222,"Woman found guilty of splashing hot soup on victim
The Straits Times (Singapore)
June 17, 2022 Friday","She could not get along with a fellow tenant in their Jalan Besar home and the two women often squabbled with each other.
 Yeap Kim Ngoh, now 73, was then in a relationship with the landlord of the property, and the prosecution said that previously, there was ""an indication"" that the other resident, Ms Jin Pingping, had also been his girlfriend.
 ""This complicated matters between the parties,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Joseph Gwee.
 Ms Jin's age and that of the landlord were not disclosed in court documents.
 Tension between the two women came to a head on Feb 4, 2020 when Yeap, a Malaysian, splashed some hot soup on Ms Jin, injuring her.
 After a trial, District Judge Chay Yuen Fatt yesterday found Yeap guilty of using a heated substance to voluntarily hurt her victim.
 According to court documents, both women were tenants of a living area above a shophouse in Jalan Besar.
 The DPP said in his submissions: ""There was some tension between the pair... Both have testified that these quarrels would also be fairly frequent but the disagreements were limited to verbal disputes.""
 He said that on the night of Feb 4, 2020, Yeap quarrelled with Ms Jin over the use of the cooking area.
 At the time, Yeap was cooking seafood soup in a metal pot.
 Ms Jin, who was living in the property with her grandchild at the time of the incident, testified during the trial that she was walking past Yeap towards a toilet when she felt some hot soup on her back.
 The prosecutor told Judge Chay: ""Jin was shocked and angered, and both she and the accused got into a loud argument again, where (the landlord) and other tenants came in to separate the parties.""
 Ms Jin later lodged a police report about the attack.
 She also went to the Singapore General Hospital, where she was found to have sustained injuries, including superficial burns on the back of her neck and upper back.
 Yeap, who is represented by lawyers Michael S. Chia and Wang Shi Mei, did not dispute that some of the soup she was cooking had landed on Ms Jin.
 DPP Gwee said: ""The defence had contended that the accused was startled by Jin and the accused's act of splashing the soup on Jin was accidental.
 ""The accused also testified that the soup was not boiling at the material time. The accused had contended that only 'a bit of soup landed on (Jin)' and it was Jin's wet clothing (resulting from the soup) that worsened the injury.""
 Yeap's mitigation and sentencing will be held on June 30.

223,"Healing the Divide's Iris Koh seeks court permission to leave Singapore for cancer treatment
Channel NewsAsia
June 17, 2022 Friday 12:28 PM GMT","SINGAPORE: The founder of Healing the Divide, a group with a known stance against vaccination, has applied to leave Singapore to receive treatment for thyroid cancer.
District Judge Ng Peng Hong on Friday (Jun 17) adjourned the matter for Iris Koh Shu Cii to provide more information on her intention to travel to Malaysia for medical treatment. She will return to court next week.
Koh faces two charges. One is for conspiring with Dr Jipson Quah to defraud the Ministry of Health (MOH) into believing people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine between July 2021 and January this year.
The other is for obstructing a police inspector by refusing to sign and tearing up a copy of her statement while in lock-up in January.
The 46-year-old is out on bail for S$20,000. People on bail are required to stay in Singapore, and must apply for the court's permission to leave jurisdiction if they wish to go overseas. They must provide information such as the purpose, destination and duration of their trip.
Defence lawyer Wee Pan Lee had informed the court that his client was seeking permission to leave Singapore on Jun 19 to visit Malacca and Negeri Sembilan, before returning on Jul 22.
In Malacca, he said Koh would go to Makhota Medical Centre for a consultation with a doctor, who is expected to recommend that she receive therapy at Aenon Health Care in Negeri Sembilan. The therapy is expected to last from Jun 19 to Jun 29.
He said his client was unable to provide details of her transport and accommodation arrangements as these would only be made after her application to leave jurisdiction was granted. According to Mr Wee, a doctor at the Singapore General Hospital had recommended the removal of Koh's thyroid gland as treatment for her cancer, and she was seeking ""alternative therapeutic treatment"" as opposed to ""invasive surgical removal"".
He added that Koh's bailor, Mr Raymond Ng who is her husband, would not be travelling with her.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke-yue argued that the documents supplied for Koh's application were ""lacking"".
He said the prosecution had asked for information on the nature of the treatment Koh would receive, the need to travel to Malaysia including whether alternative treatments in Singapore had been explored, and the necessity of travelling for one month and to two locations.
Mr Jiang said that documents provided by Koh's lawyer also suggested that a third location in Kuala Lumpur, named Spectrum of Life, would also be part of her travel plans.
He said that there was no explanation of the link between these three institutions in Malacca, Negeri Sembilan and Kuala Lumpur.
""I want to emphasise we are not standing in the way of Ms Koh's desire to seek alternative treatment of her choosing. We just need some answers, some clarification,"" he said.
Noting that Koh made her application on Jun 13, he also asked: ""Why was this not started earlier so that information could be provided for the authorities' proper assessment?""
In response, her defence lawyer argued that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to suggest his client was a flight risk.
Mr Wee also said Koh was ""devastated"" after her diagnosis, spoke to various doctors and made her application ""as soon as possible"".
Judge Ng said that based on the information before him, Koh's medical condition ""doesn't appear to be life-threatening at this point in time"".
""It appears that we need some explanation,"" he said, adjourning the hearing of the application for the defence to provide more details.
The Healing the Divide group has described COVID-19 vaccination as ""medical coercion"", while MOH said the group adopts an ""anti-vaccination stance"" and ""has a history of sharing misleading information about COVID-19 and its vaccines"".
If convicted of voluntarily obstructing a public servant in the discharge of their public functions, Koh could be jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$2,500 or both.
If convicted of criminal conspiracy to make false representations, she could be jailed for up to 20 years, fined or both. INITIAL: dv(ta)",Channel NewsAsia,20-06-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999961261674863}",en,0.9999961261674863
224,"Healing the Divide founder Iris Koh seeks permission to travel abroad for alternative cancer treatment while on bail
Today (Singapore) - Online
June 17, 2022 Friday","SINGAPORE - Iris Koh, the founder of controversial anti-vaccine group Healing the Divide, sought permission from a district court on Friday (June 17) to travel to Malaysia in order to seek ""alternative"" medical treatment for her thyroid cancer. However, a judge asked for more details of her treatment after noting that her condition does not appear to be life-threatening at the moment, based on her current documentation. Koh made the request to leave Singapore while she is on bail for an ongoing court case. The 46-year-old faces a criminal charge of conspiring with a doctor to defraud the Ministry of Health (MOH) over fake Covid-19 vaccination records, and another charge of obstructing a police officer by refusing to sign and tearing up a charge sheet. 
When she was first hauled to court in January, she was denied bail twice and warded in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for hyperthyroidism, a pre-existing condition for her. She was also diagnosed with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid gland. It is a common cause of hyperthyroidism. She has remained out on a S$20,000 bail since Feb 4. Her husband Raymond Ng, who serves as her bailor, was also present in court. On Friday, her new defence counsel Wee Pan Lee told the court that SGH doctors found cancer in a thyroid nodule, which is an unusual growth of cells in the thyroid gland. She was then advised to undergo surgery to remove her thyroid glands. However, she wants a second opinion from foreign doctors to ""find a way to save"" them, Mr Wee said. She has therefore made appointments at Mahkota Medical Centre in the city of Malacca, as well as at Aenon Health Care in the western Malaysian state of Negeri Sembilan, Mr Wee added. Koh sought to travel there by car and will be in Malaysia for a month from Sunday to July 22. The programme at Mahkota runs until June 29 and a doctor there will recommend a course of therapy treatment at Aenon, Mr Wee told the court. In response, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Jiang Ke-Yue asked for clarifications to firm up the prosecution's position on Koh's application. The prosecutor said that the defence has provided supporting documents that ""raise more questions than answers"", which ""lends itself to the inference that there could be a potential flight risk"". He told the court that he has asked Mr Wee for details on the nature of Koh's treatment, whether she has explored alternative treatment options in Singapore, and the need to go to two places in Malaysia for a month. DPP Jiang said that the prosecution does not wish to stand in Koh's way to seek alternative treatment of her choosing. However, he argued that the documents do not show any link between the two medical institutions in Malaysia. Mr Wee also filed a document this morning from a third Malaysian institution - Spectrum Of Life Integrated Wellness Centre in Kuala Lumpur. DPP Jiang said that the lawyer has similarly not explained how it is linked to the other institutions. When the prosecutor questioned why the application and documents were filed at the eleventh hour, Mr Wee said that Koh had been ""devastated"" by her diagnosis. ""Upon recommendation that there is an alternative, she seized the chance but was unable to go. This doctor was prepared to see her... That's why we made the application as soon as possible,"" the lawyer added. District Judge Ng Peng Hong said that based on the documents he was given, Koh's condition ""doesn't appear to be life-threatening at this point"". He then agreed with the prosecution that more details of her treatment should be given. The case will be heard again on June 22. THE CASE INVOLVING FAKE VACCINE SHOTS Koh is said to have worked with general practitioner Jipson Quah to defraud MOH between July last year and January this year, by agreeing to dishonestly make false representations to MOH that people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine when they were not. Quah and his clinic assistant, Thomas Chua Cheng Soon, have also been charged with fraud by false representation. Both men remain out on bail. The police previously said that Koh had allegedly referred clients, believed to be members of Healing the Divide, to Quah and had also suggested administering something else in lieu of the vaccine to patients. Quah has been suspended from practising medicine for 18 months, after the Singapore Medical Council found that he allegedly administered saline solution to some 15 people in place of a Covid-19 vaccine. He then uploaded false vaccination statuses into the National Immunisation Registry system of MOH. He also purportedly charged up to S$1,500 for these fake jabs. Quah is said to have conspired with Chua and a woman named Mehrajunnisha to lie to MOH that she received the Sinopharm vaccine when she did not. It is unclear if Mehrajunnisha was a member of Healing the Divide. A 43-year-old Australian, David Christopher Newton, was charged last week with conspiring with Quah and Chua to receive a vaccination certificate when he had not received the Sinopharm vaccine. Quah does not face any charges of conspiring with Koh at the moment. However, prosecutors had said that investigations were ongoing and that they were unsure if more alleged offences would be uncovered. If convicted of conspiring to dishonestly make false representations to MOH, Koh could be jailed up to 20 years or fined, or punished with both. Those convicted of obstructing a public servant in discharge of their public functions can be jailed up to three months or fined up to S$2,500, or both.",Today (Singapore) - Online,17-06-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999967683613796}",en,0.9999967683613796

The Straits Times (Singapore)
June 18, 2022 Saturday","Iris Koh, founder of anti-vaccine group Healing the Divide, has requested to go to Malaysia during an ongoing court case to seek treatment for thyroid cancer, the court heard yesterday.
 District Judge Ng Peng Hong said her condition does not appear to be life-threatening and called for an adjournment until June 22, asking for more details.
 The application was made by her new defence counsel, Mr Wee Pan Lee, who said Koh, 46, suffered from cancer and had been recommended by Singapore General Hospital to undergo surgery to remove her thyroid gland.
 But she wanted a second opinion from foreign doctors, said Mr Wee, adding that Koh was also diagnosed with Graves' disease, an immune system disorder that affects the thyroid gland.
 Koh has made appointments at Mahkota Medical Centre in Malacca and Aenon Health Care in Negeri Sembilan during her planned trip between June 19 and July 22. She will first visit Mahkota and a doctor there will recommend a course of treatment at Aenon, said the lawyer.
 He filed a document yesterday for Koh to visit a third institution - Spectrum of Life - in Kuala Lumpur during the planned trip.
 Deputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke-Yue questioned the need for such a lengthy period of travel. He added that the documents did not show any link between the medical centres.
 ""Where one provides more documents that raise more questions than answers, that itself lends to the inference that there is a potential flight risk. We are not saying that there will be, but we need more information to be in a better position to agree to travel. The appropriate cause would be an adjournment,"" he said.
 Agreeing with the prosecution, the judge said: ""This condition does not appear to be life-threatening at this point in time based on the submissions I have heard.""
 Koh's bail was extended and she will return to court on June 22. She was earlier accused of conspiring with general practitioner Jipson Quah to make false representations to the Ministry of Health that unvaccinated people were given the Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine, when they were not.
 Quah, who has been suspended from practising medicine for 18 months, was also charged with fraud by false representation and granted bail.
 In February, Koh was handed another charge over ripping up a printed copy of her statement recorded at a police station.
 She had been hospitalised prior to her court hearing on Jan 28, but her condition was not mentioned in court then.

226,"Man slashes wife with cleaver, assaults and spits on workers at SGH and IMH
Today (Singapore) - Online
June 20, 2022 Monday","SINGAPORE - Soon after choking his wife, physically abusing her, slashing her arm with a cleaver and threatening to kill her, Wee Guo Qiang took out his aggression on several medical personnel. He also spat at hospital workers and made racist and religiously charged remarks at a nurse, who was taking his vital signs while he was warded at Singapore General Hospital (SGH). The 26-year-old Singaporean was jailed for one year, seven months and two weeks on Monday (June 20). This was backdated to June last year when he was remanded. He pleaded guilty to seven charges, including causing hurt to his wife with a dangerous weapon, criminal intimidation and causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty. District Judge Tan Jen Tse considered another 13 similar charges for sentencing purposes. 
The court heard that Wee, who was married to a 34-year-old woman from China, grew intoxicated in the wee hours of Dec 28 in 2020. He then woke up his wife in bed by hugging her. When she told him that he reeked of alcohol and he should not disturb her, he sat on the lower part of her body and bit her shoulder, refusing to release her. He then choked her with both hands, causing her to almost lose consciousness. He also threatened to strangle her to death, before eventually releasing his grip and saying that he would kill her. She pleaded with him not to because she has a child. It is not clear if the child is from their marriage. Wee retrieved an electrical kettle from the living room and poured warm water over her head, then threw the kettle at her forehead. He proceeded to grab her hair and hit her head against a cupboard mirror repeatedly. The mirror later cracked from the impact. Not satisfied, Wee took a cleaver from the kitchen, pointed it at his wife and threatened to chop her to death. He then slashed her upper left arm with the weapon. She could not retaliate because her limbs had gone numb after the choking earlier in bed. In a bid to stop him, she claimed that she suspected she was pregnant. This prompted him to stop his attack and call for an ambulance. She was hospitalised at Changi General Hospital for two days and given several more days of hospitalisation leave. Wee was then charged and released on court-imposed bail. KICKED AND BIT HOSPITAL WORKERS However, on May 5 last year, he grew aggressive when warded at SGH. Court documents did not state why he was hospitalised. A Certis Cisco auxiliary police officer, along with some colleagues and an SGH staff member, tried to tie his legs to prevent him from further kicking a nurse who was checking on his intravenous drip. Wee threatened to complain about them on social media and said that they would be ""done for"" if he did so. He also verbally abused them with vulgarities and threatened to sue them, before kicking the auxiliary policeman on his chest. A few hours later, an assistant nurse clinician was taking Wee's vital signs. He then sat up and bit the restraint on his hand. When the nurse tried to stop him, he started shouting more vulgarities and challenged the victim to stop him. The male nurse told Wee that it was against his religion, as a Muslim, to hit people. Wee responded by shouting religiously and racially offensive comments, adding: ""I'm going to find you outside and I am going to kill you."" He also held onto the victim's shirt and tried to bite his hand. The following day, he punched another nurse on her face while she was preparing a new restraint for him. He also verbally abused her. SPAT ON ENFORCEMENT OFFICER, PSYCHIATRIST Two days later, Wee was taken to Sengkang General Hospital from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for medical treatment due to a drug overdose. Once again, he turned aggressive after auxiliary police officers told him that they could not release him from his restraints. He spat a mouthful of water at one of the officers and scolded him with phrases such as ""karma will get you"" and ""you will be hit by a car"". He was then taken back to IMH's emergency services department. There, he shouted and threatened some of the hospital workers, saying that after he was discharged, he would go back to IMH with a knife and slash all of them. He also struggled to get out of his restraints and tried to spit at them. He was eventually taken to a room where a psychiatrist assessed his condition and ordered that he be given an injection to calm him down. When she returned a few hours later to re-interview him, he spat at her twice. The next day, an IMH psychologist made a police report stating that Wee had threatened to kill a few hospital employees upon his release, and to take an auxiliary officer's gun and shoot himself. He had also asked the psychologist if she wanted to get slashed. Another psychiatrist filed a separate report, stating that he had ""grave concerns"" about the safety of all IMH employees. The following day, a senior IMH nurse saw Wee peeping at the female patients' section and shouting loudly. The male nurse told him to behave, which led Wee to start challenging and asking the nurse to put diapers on him because he was a four-year-old child. Wee then punched the nurse on the cheek before auxiliary police officers and the nurse pinned him to the ground. He also threatened to kill the nurse and alleged that he had a ""knife inside a car"".",Today (Singapore) - Online,20-06-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999972913388402}",en,0.9999972913388402
227,"Healing the Divide's Iris Koh given permission to leave Singapore for cancer treatment
Channel NewsAsia
June 23, 2022 Thursday 1:21 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: The founder of Healing the Divide, a group with a known stance against vaccination, was on Thursday (Jun 23) given permission by a court to leave Singapore for cancer treatment in Malaysia.
Iris Koh Shu Cii, 46, has been allowed to travel to Melaka from Jun 24 to Jul 17 to undergo a consultation at Makhota Medical Centre for alternative treatment for thyroid cancer.
The court imposed additional leave jurisdiction conditions on Koh. She must put up an additional S$30,000 in bail, on top of her current S$20,000 bail. Upon her return, she must also provide supporting documents on the cancer treatment she received to the investigation officer handling her case.
Other usual leave jurisdiction conditions also apply, requiring Koh to provide her complete travel itinerary and details of her overseas address and contact number before departure. She must also remain contactable by the investigation officer.
Koh faces two charges. One is for conspiring with a doctor, Jipson Quah, to defraud the Ministry of Health (MOH) into believing people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine between July 2021 and January this year.
The other is for obstructing a police inspector by refusing to sign and tearing up a copy of her statement while in lock-up in January. Koh had applied for permission to leave jurisdiction last week, and the matter was adjourned to Thursday for her to provide more information requested by the prosecution.
Koh's lawyer, Wee Pan Lee, previously told the court she had intended to travel from Jun 19 to Jul 22 to undergo a consultation at Makhota Medical Centre in Melaka and receive treatment at Aenon Health Care in Negeri Sembilan.
On Thursday, he updated the court that she would be travelling only to Melaka, and would return on the eve of her next court mention on Jul 18.
""The purpose of this travel is to seek a consultation for a second opinion with a view to alternative cancer treatment,"" said Mr Wee.
He said that since Koh's diagnosis, doctors in Singapore had advised her on only one course of treatment, which was the removal of her thyroid gland.
""My client is apprehensive about this treatment because she is trained in music, she is trained in singing and she is a trained vocal coach. Before her arrest, she earned her living as a choir conductor, as a singer in a choir and teaching singing and giving vocal coaching lessons,"" argued the lawyer.
""The fear is that this surgery, which is going to be performed very near the vocal chords, might affect her voice.""
He said that since Koh was told about alternative cancer treatments that did not require removal of her thyroid gland, she wished to try this ""Plan B"".
""This is not the forum to adjudge or assess whether Plan B is medically correct or wrong,"" he added.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke-yue said the prosecution was not objecting to Koh's application, but sought additional conditions for her to leave jurisdiction.
He said that the documents initially furnished for Koh's application last week were ""inadequate"" and ""incomplete"" and contained discrepancies.
He said the defence had since provided new information from the Singapore General Hospital ""confirming her cancer diagnosis and the need for thyroid removal surgery urgently or as soon as possible"".
Mr Jiang also noted that Koh's application had ""narrowed"" from her initial application to travel to two destinations - with supporting documents naming a third institute in Kuala Lumpur - to one destination in Melaka, and for a shorter duration.
But he argued that there were still gaps in information, such as no explanation of the link between the three institutes named in supporting documents, and the prosecution was therefore proposing the additional leave jurisdiction conditions.
The prosecutor had initially sought additional bail of S$40,000, but Mr Wee, Koh's lawyer, argued that this was ""punishing"" and proposed an additional S$20,000 that could be furnished by another bailor besides Koh's current bailor, her husband, Raymond Ng.
District Judge Ng Peng Hong granted Koh's application and the prosecution's request for the additional leave jurisdiction conditions, ordering that the additional bail of S$30,000 can be put up by another bailor.
If convicted of voluntarily obstructing a public servant in the discharge of their public functions, Koh could be jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$2,500 or both.
If convicted of criminal conspiracy to make false representations, she could be jailed for up to 20 years, fined or both. INITIAL: ac",Channel NewsAsia,24-06-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999967438457328}",en,0.9999967438457328
228,"Court allows Healing the Divide founder Iris Koh to leave Singapore to seek alternative cancer treatment
Today (Singapore) - Online
June 23, 2022 Thursday","SINGAPORE - A district court has granted an application by Iris Koh, the founder of controversial anti-vaccine group Healing the Divide, to leave the country for Malaysia to seek alternative medical treatment for her thyroid cancer. On Thursday (June 23), District Judge Ng Peng Hong imposed an additional bail sum of S$30,000 for her to travel to Malacca and get a second opinion from a doctor there. The 46-year-old will leave Singapore on Friday and return on July 17, one day before her case is heard again in court, said her lawyer Wee Pan Lee. She was diagnosed shortly after being charged in January with conspiring to defraud the Ministry of Health (MOH) over fake-Covid-19 vaccination records. 
She has been out on a S$20,000 bail since Feb 4. All accused persons on bail must get permission from the courts to leave the jurisdiction. Koh made the travel request last Friday through her lawyer, saying she wanted to go to Malaysia for a month. However, the case was adjourned to Thursday after District Judge Ng and Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Jiang Ke-Yue asked for more details about the nature of her proposed treatment. DOES NOT WANT TO DAMAGE VOCAL CHORDS On Thursday, Koh's defence counsel, Mr Wee, said his client's plans had changed. Koh previously wanted to travel to two medical institutes in Malaysia - Malacca and the western Malaysian state of Negeri Sembilan - but now plans to only go to Malacca. Mr Wee elaborated on his client's unease over undergoing surgery to remove her thyroid glands, a treatment which was recommended by Singapore General Hospital when she was diagnosed. He told the court that since last week, she has also seen two other doctors who have recommended the same surgery. The lawyer said: ""My client is apprehensive about this treatment because she is trained in music, trained in singing and she is a trained vocal coach. Before her arrest, she earned her living as a choir conductor, as a singer in the choir, and teaching singing and giving vocal coaching lessons. ""The fear is that this surgery, which is to be performed very near the vocal cords, might affect her voice. As a result of that, she is seeking an alternative."" Mr Wee asked for permission for Koh to travel to Malacca to see if she's suitable for an alternative treatment plan. In response, DPP Jiang said he did not object to Koh's application but sought additional conditions, including a further cash bail sum of S$40,000. The prosecutor also reiterated his concerns about ""gaps"" in Mr Wee's supporting documentation. He had previously flagged discrepancies between documents given by the medical institutes in Malaysia, including a third one in Kuala Lumpur. DPP Jiang acknowledged that Koh now only wants to seek treatment from one clinic, but he said she has ""given no explanation"" about the others. He also said that SGH has given an update confirming Koh's cancer diagnosis and the ""need for thyroid removal surgery urgently or as soon as possible"". ""I note the diagnosis was as early on as in March, and since then there has been no follow-up for conventional or alternative treatments. Then today, we are faced with this,"" DPP Jiang added. Mr Wee then asked for a smaller additional bail of S$20,000, saying that S$40,000 was ""punishing"" for Koh. District Judge Ng ultimately decided to impose an additional S$30,000 bail that can be furnished by another bailor. He also gave the following conditions for Koh to abide by: To give a complete itinerary before travelling To remain contactable by the investigation officer To give full details of where she is staying in Malaysia, as well as her contact number there, to the investigation officer To provide supporting documents on her alternative treatment and surrender her passport to the authorities upon returning to Singapore ACCUSED OF CONSPIRING TO DEFRAUD MOH Koh currently faces a criminal charge of conspiring with a doctor, Jipson Quah, to defraud the MOH over fake Covid-19 vaccination records and another charge of obstructing a police officer by refusing to sign and tearing up a charge sheet. Quah and his clinic assistant, Thomas Chua Cheng Soon, have also been charged with fraud by false representation. Both men remain out on bail. The police previously said that Koh had allegedly referred clients, believed to be members of Healing the Divide, to Quah and had also suggested administering something else in lieu of the vaccine to patients.

229,"Birthday celebration ends with trip to hospital; Glass shower door falls on woman at Sentosa hotel during staycation for daughter's birthday
The Straits Times (Singapore)
June 24, 2022 Friday","A staycation to celebrate her daughter's birthday ended with a trip to the hospital when the hotel room's glass shower door fell on Ms Suziyana Hamid and shattered, leaving her with cuts across her body.
 The incident took place at Siloso Beach Resort on June 16 at about 4.30am, after a day of festivities on Sentosa to mark her daughter's 12th birthday.
 Ms Suziyana, 41, a senior executive in a local non-profit organisation, said the glass shower door came off its hinges as she pulled it open.
 She put her arm up to protect herself as the glass door hit her and shattered. The shards cut her on the arms, hands, chest and scalp.
 She said her daughter was shocked to see her in such a state and tried to console her.
 ""When she saw me crying, she said 'Ibu (mother), it's okay, you are okay',"" Ms Suziyana said.
 She was later taken to the hospital, where doctors and nurses picked the glass pieces out with tweezers.
 She was given two days of medical leave.
 The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) confirmed it had received a call for help at Siloso Beach Resort at about 4.30am on June 16 and had taken a patient to Singapore General Hospital.
 Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC), which oversees the resort island and is the hotel's landlord, said it takes the matter very seriously and will be looking into the matter, in e-mails seen by The Straits Times.
 SDC representatives visited the hotel room while Ms Suziyana was in hospital. When contacted, the hotel declined to comment.
 ST understands that the police are not investigating the matter.
 Ms Suziyana said her husband Reduan Nordin, 41, who works in the construction sector and was also at the hotel, called the front desk for help after ringing the SCDF and a staff member delivered bandages to their room.
 She said the hotel has not contacted them since she was discharged from the hospital.
 Industry expert Victor Sia, the research and development engineer at SG Glass, said there are several reasons why tempered glass - often used in bathroom settings - might shatter.
 This could be due to the inclusion of nickel sulphide, which could result in breakage even without impact, he said.
 The door could also have shattered due to the hinges exerting high mechanical stress on the glass, he added.
 The use of tempered glass is often necessary to meet impact and safety levels, Mr Sia said, adding that normal glass breaks into large shards, which pose a greater risk of injury.
 Those who find themselves in a similar situation should try to evade the falling glass door and not attempt to stop its fall, he added.",The Straits Times (Singapore),23-06-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999964804110533}",en,0.9999964804110533
230,"Kidney transplants in S'pore fall over past 2 years amid pandemic; Waiting time for donor kidney has grown longer, with number of people in queue steadily climbing
The Straits Times (Singapore)
June 26, 2022 Sunday","The number of kidney transplants - already decreasing before the Covid-19 pandemic hit - has fallen over the past two years, even as the waiting time for a donor kidney grows longer.
 In 2019, there were 33 kidney transplant operations involving dead donors carried out in Singapore; but only 15 kidney transplants took place in 2020 and just 24 last year. Living-donor transplants were also affected, falling from 56 in 2019 to 31 in 2020, before going up to 47 last year.
 In contrast, the number of people here waiting for a kidney has steadily climbed. There were 330 people on the transplant wait list in 2019 and 371 last year.
 The average waiting time for a kidney from a dead donor is now 97.4 months, or just over eight years.
 Doctors said Covid-19 is to blame for the backlog, as staff were redeployed to help with the pandemic and operations were postponed, especially when the patients were deemed to be high-risk.
 Associate Professor Terence Kee, who is director of the Singapore General Hospital's (SGH) renal transplant programme, said the first year of the pandemic hit patients especially hard.
 ""Even though the circuit breaker lasted only two months, more than 100 SGH patients were affected as processing of referrals and evaluations were suspended,"" he said.
 Evaluations for living donor kidney transplants were put on hold, as was placement on the dead-donor wait list.
 ""Our staff were deployed elsewhere to support Covid-19 efforts such as the isolation wards, perimeter screening and swabbing operations,"" said Prof Kee.
 Dr Hersharan Kaur Sran, from the National University Hospital's (NUH) adult kidney and pancreas transplantation programme, said her hospital's experience was much the same.
 The hospital's transplant team received fewer referrals from kidney doctors, who were swamped, and transplants involving dead donors dropped significantly due to concerns about infection transmission, among other things.
 For instance, organs from higher-risk donors - such as people who were older or less healthy - were turned down, said Dr Hersharan, a senior consultant at the National University Centre for Organ Transplantation.
 This was because such transplants require more medical resources and increase the risk of recipients having to stay longer in hospital or needing intensive care.
 Professor Tan Chee Kiat, who is director of the Health Ministry's National Organ Transplant Unit, said Singapore has one of the highest rates of diabetic kidney failure in the world.
 About 5.7 people are diagnosed with kidney failure daily, and two in three cases of kidney failure are due to diabetes. There are more than 8,500 dialysis patients in Singapore.
 For patients with end-stage disease, kidney transplants are often the best option. But even before the pandemic, the number of organs from dead donors was already in decline, largely because they were medically unsuitable for various reasons, he said.
 ""On the other hand, there is an increase in the prevalence of kidney failure and hence a corresponding increase in the waiting time for a kidney transplant.""
 He added that the proportion of people who were put on the wait list during the pandemic, as compared with those who died or were taken off the list, remained relatively stable.
 Dr Hersharan said 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the people on the National University Centre for Organ Transplantation's wait list are removed every year as they are no longer medically suitable for transplantation, while less than 5 per cent die.
 Before the pandemic, it used to add between 50 and 60 patients to the wait list each year. This dropped to between 30 and 40 yearly after Covid-19 struck.
 The good news is that transplant numbers are slowly picking up, as hospitals adjust to the new normal.
 Prof Kee said SGH had established a robust system of screening for Covid-19, requiring donors and recipients to self-isolate before surgery and undergo repeated tests for the virus.
 This is because transplant recipients are on drugs to prevent their immune systems from rejecting the transplant, and a Covid-19 infection could prove fatal.
 ""In other words, we have demonstrated that the processes in place allow us to perform kidney transplantation safely even during a pandemic,"" he said.
 As pressure from the pandemic eases off, Singapore will need to get back to business as usual for transplants, Dr Hersharan said. This means increasing referrals and accepting higher-risk donors and patients. ""Western countries have already increased transplantation rates to pre-pandemic levels,"" she added. ""Hence, we are hopeful we can follow suit.""
 Mr Koh Cheun Yang, 44, has been on the kidney transplant wait list for 14 years. He has had both kidneys removed due to a condition which results in cysts forming in them, and goes for dialysis three times a week.
 His doctor at NUH told him that the pandemic would impact his chances of getting a new kidney, but he remains upbeat.
 ""I just follow the doctors' and nurses' advice and keep positive,"" said Mr Koh, who works in information technology. ""I've been living my life normally, so it's not a big blow to me. I've been waiting for so long already.""

231,"SGH pilots new non-surgical procedure for kidney patients; Less invasive method allows them to avoid undergoing surgery before starting dialysis
The Straits Times (Singapore)
June 30, 2022 Thursday","Patients with end-stage kidney failure may soon no longer have to undergo surgery before beginning dialysis, thanks to a new procedure being piloted by Singapore General Hospital (SGH).
 Associate Professor Tan Chieh Suai, head and senior consultant at SGH's department of renal medicine, announced this on Tuesday.
 In 2020, 7,125 such patients - about three in four - chose to go for a form of dialysis known as haemodialysis, up from 4,270 in 2011, he added.
 Haemodialysis involves using a dialysis machine and an artificial kidney to clean the blood of kidney patients. For the blood to be extracted from patients, however, an access point needs to be created in the body.
 Prof Tan said the best way of doing this is through the creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF), which involves joining a vein and an artery together and causing blood from the artery to flow through the vein.
 This increases blood flow in the vein, allowing blood to be extracted from it, explained Professor Tay Kiang Hiong, head and senior consultant at SGH's department of vascular and interventional radiology.
 Traditionally, an AVF would have to be created through a surgical procedure on the patient's arm.
 However, about 80 per cent of patients with end-stage kidney failure here choose to put off such procedures for various reasons, including fear of surgery, being unable to accept their diagnosis, and worry about the scars left behind by the procedure, said Prof Tan.
 This results in many of them having to be admitted for emergency dialysis using a catheter.
 But this increases the risk of patients getting infected as well as internal bleeding, said Prof Tan, adding that eventually, an AVF has to be created in these patients.
 The method piloted by SGH is much less invasive.
 Known as endovascular AVF (endoAVF), the non-surgical procedure can be done in either of two ways. A needle is inserted in the vein under the skin and guided into an artery using ultrasound.
 A specially designed catheter with a clip is later inserted to link the vein and artery.
 Alternatively, needles are inserted into the vein and artery, allowing two catheters - both of which have magnets attached - to be inserted as well.
 The magnets will be attracted to each other, pulling the artery and vein together. An electrical current is then passed through the catheters, burning a hole between the artery and vein.
 Prof Tan said endoAVF is faster, taking around 15 minutes at best, compared with 45 to 90 minutes for the traditional way.
 EndoAVF also leaves no scars, whereas the traditional method typically leaves scars of between 3cm and 10cm on patients' arms.
 Also, while patients getting an AVF through surgery require up to three balloon angioplasty procedures a year to maintain their AVFs, those who undergo endoAVF need to do this only once every two years.
 Associate Professor Chong Tze Tec, head and senior consultant at SGH's department of vascular surgery, said that because the traditional method involves moving veins around, the surrounding tissues will be disrupted, resulting in the vein which blood is extracted from becoming narrower as well.
 The endoAVF method does not cause this problem.
 Prof Tan said that a previous pilot programme launched by SGH in October last year with 13 patients had produced encouraging results, with a 90 per cent success rate.
 By the end of the year, SGH will launch a three-year pilot programme to offer endoAVF to 200 eligible patients from SGH, Changi General Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital and National University Hospital.
 Prof Chong said the suitability of a patient for endoAVF depends on many technical considerations, including the position of his veins and arteries, and the size of his veins.
 But he hoped the pilot would allow doctors to adjust the procedure so it could be offered to more patients in the future.
 Prof Tan said SGH is partnering community dialysis service providers so that nurses can be trained to conduct dialysis on patients who have undergone the new procedure as well.
 ""The aim of all this is to shift care from the tertiary institutions to the community by reducing the need for these patients to come to the hospital,"" he said.
    SHIFTING CARE TO COMMUNITY  The aim of all this is to shift care from the tertiary institutions to the community by reducing the need for these patients to come to the hospital.

232,"Adulting 101: I take revenge on my lack of free time by delaying sleep at night, but I know it&#039;s time to stop
Today (Singapore) - Online
July 2, 2022 Saturday","SINGAPORE - It's 12am, I'm in bed watching the latest season of Stranger Things on Netflix and I have arrived yet again at the same dilemma I face every night: Do I hit the ""next episode"" button (this last one ended on another cliffhanger...) or do I pick the sensible option of switching off my lights and going to bed? Unfortunately, most of the time, I choose the former, knowing full well that the happiness derived from watching another few episodes will come at a cost - waking up the next morning with a pounding headache and feeling like a zombie the entire day. When I was a university student, sleeping late didn't affect me as much since I had more control over my schedule. I signed up for classes that took place later in the day, and I could generally choose what time to wake up each day and finish my assignments. Since I started working, though, I've had to give up that control - I don't get to choose what news assignments to cover and some days, I might have to attend media briefings or rush down to the site of a breaking news event as early as 8am. 
Since then, my sleep habits have deteriorated. Now that I have less free time in the day, I find myself sleeping later so I can squeeze in more activities before bed, such as playing video games, scrolling through TikTok or watching YouTube videos of cute dogs. And even though it's taking a toll on my health, I can't seem to help myself and I know I'm not the only one stuck in this loop. A study by senior research fellow Stijn Massar and Dr Michael Chee from the Sleep and Cognition Laboratory at the National University of Singapore (NUS) found that out of the 321 adolescents, university students and staff they surveyed over the past two years, 55 per cent said that they frequently go to bed later than intended. In an effort to figure out how to break my unhealthy patterns, I spoke to some experts. REVENGE BEDTIME PROCRASTINATION The term ""bedtime procrastination"" was first used in 2014 by Dutch researchers to explain how a lack of self-discipline results in people sleeping later than intended. Later, the word ""revenge"" was added to the term by users on Chinese social media, giving it a layer of extra meaning. Dr Leow Leong Chai, director of the sleep disorders unit at Singapore General Hospital, said that ""revenge bedtime procrastination"" was coined to describe people who are so busy with work and other commitments that they do not have any time for activities that they enjoy. ""In other words, they take 'revenge' on their busy work and social life by knowingly procrastinating their bedtime so that they can do what they enjoy instead of going to sleep,"" he added. Agreeing, Dr Chee from NUS said that this is exacerbated by the pull of social media, which makes it difficult for people to put down their phones. ""People may want to spend a bit of 'me time' by using social media before bed, but the time just passes because the content that's offered online is so compelling."" Dr Chee is the director of Centre for Sleep and Cognition at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine in NUS. He added that the sole goal of social media developers is to ""capture your attention and hold it"" and they ""will find every way to hook you"". ""They aren't going to think about your mental well-being and loss of sleep,"" Dr Chee said. This is something I personally struggle with and a friend I spoke to also mentioned that she uses Instagram to ""wind down"" before bed but ends up getting carried away with it. ""Screen time is so bad, I usually start to wind down at 11pm but before I know it, two hours have passed,"" she said. Other than revenge bedtime procrastination, certain people may delay sleeping because they find sleep to be a waste of time. Ms Ng Ai Ling, the head of counselling and principal psychotherapist at Eagles Mediation and Counselling Centre, said: ""For those who espouse the Fomo (fear of missing out) and Yolo (you only live once) philosophy, sleeping is an unproductive time during which they could be losing out to their peers."" This fear drives them to work harder in order to keep up with others, which could be through pursuing social and leisure interests. For others, an eagerness to achieve may drive them to sacrifice sleep, so that they can use the time to take on side gigs or part-time studies after their day job, she added. WHAT IS THE UNDERLYING ISSUE? In order to break the habit and start sleeping on time, Ms Ng suggested reflecting on these questions to help identify the underlying cause of bedtime procrastination: What is the unmet need in my life that is causing me to stay up in search of it? Why do I keep needing to do more - what am I doing more for? What am I dissatisfied with in my current life? What is the deep-seated need inside me that I'm trying to meet? ""For example, the underlying issue may be a lack of clarity about your purpose in life. You could then address this by going for professional coaching or counselling, which would be more helpful than staying up late to scroll through social media,"" she said. These questions got me thinking as well and I realised that the weeks when I struggle the most with bedtime procrastination are the ones when I am more stressed at work. This translates into staying up late in order to extend my ""me time"" and ""delay"" the next day from arriving, which is not a healthy way to manage stress. HOW CAN I TURN INTO AN EARLY BIRD? So what do I have to do differently? For working adults, Dr Chee recommended going to bed before midnight so that they are able to have the recommended seven to eight hours of sleep. He added that having a healthy diet and sufficient exercise are also important. Yet, we all know this is all easier said than done, and Dr Chee himself acknowledged that the problem is also a structural one, which requires a societal level change. ""In Singapore, we have a culture where work and personal time is blurred... As a boss myself, I try not to contact my staff after office hours as it will eat into their personal time,"" he added. When people are contacted about work outside of their office hours, they might sleep even later to make up for the lost free time. Experts noted that sleep habits worsened as a result of the pandemic, because working from home eroded work-life boundaries. To counter this, Ms Ng recommended that those who work from home set a routine to disengage from work daily. For example, one could leave home for a walk to simulate ending work for the day. ""During the walk, think about what you are going to do after that. The walk back will help to disengage you from work,"" she said. She added that keeping your bedroom as a resting space and working in the living room instead is another tangible way to separate work and rest. A friend of mine has another good strategy to prevent work stress from affecting her sleep. She said: ""I see it more as energy management. If there's an event or a deadline at work, I'll try to work on it in advance so that I can sleep earlier the night before instead of stressing over it."" This gives her enough energy to get through that important day, she said, adding that she regularly sleeps early because it feels really good to wake up fresh. Although I am not quite there yet, I'll try changing my habits step by step. Perhaps I'll try stopping the episode of my Netflix show midway - once the cliffhanger from the previous episode has been resolved - so I don't get tempted to watch yet another episode when it inevitably ends on a cliffhanger. This will be easier said than done, but I have to remind myself that the effort and discipline will be worth it. I look forward to the days when I wake up fresh and am able to fully enjoy my time after work, instead of feeling terribly exhausted the entire day.

233,"Baby endured 10 tubes in prostate for cancer radiation therapy at KKH, done first time for a child
Today (Singapore) - Online
July 2, 2022 Saturday","SINGAPORE - When he is much older, little Nguyen Hai Dang could possibly tell of how brave he was when he was a mere 11-month-old baby. While undergoing a new radiation therapy for a cancerous tumour in his prostate, his testicles were relocated for a while and 10 tubings were inserted into his prostate and left there for several days. It was a sight that would make any adult feel faint. So how did this Vietnamese boy end up there on the hospital bed at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) in June 2020? The first child of Madam Nguyen Hong Nhung, he kept vomiting after drinking milk, so she thought at first that he had acid reflux, where stomach acid flows backwards from the stomach to the oesophagus. 
Acid reflux is common even in healthy infants. An ultrasound scan later showed that nothing was wrong with his stomach but it detected a kidney infection. This was caused by a tumour in his prostate, obstructing urine flow, the mother said. The baby was later diagnosed with a rare type of soft tissue cancer called embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the prostate. In an email interview with TODAY, Mdm Nguyen, 31, an accountant, recounted the shock and fear that she and her husband Nguyen Ngoc Sanh had gone through, from the time their only child was diagnosed to their desperate search for treatment. Mr Nguyen, 33, works in sales. She said: ""At the time, we felt hopeless. We could not believe that our three-month-old baby had been diagnosed with cancer."" They decided to have their child treated in Singapore after consulting with doctors in their home country. That was because treatment options in Vietnam for babies with cancer are ""limited"", Mdm Nguyen said. When the Nguyens arrived in Singapore in late-2019 and stayed with a friend, they started Hai Dang on chemotherapy at National University Hospital (NUH) before he was later referred to KKH in June 2020 for consideration of surgery and brachytherapy. The first Covid-19 wave peaked around that time and it complicated matters. ""What was difficult was that when he had a fever as a side effect of chemotherapy or an infection, he had to go to the hospital. There, he would be isolated and tested for Covid-19, which frightened him,"" Mdm Nguyen recounted. For his cancer, baby Hai Dang underwent interstitial brachytherapy, which allows radiation to be delivered directly inside a tumour through a delivery device such as plastic needles or catheter. This is unlike conventional external beam radiation therapy, which delivers radiation to an area of the body and which also often affects the surrounding healthy tissue. FIRST CHILD PATIENT TO GET TREATMENT Now three years old, Hai Dang is the first child in Singapore to have received interstitial brachytherapy for childhood cancer treatment. He was only 11 months old at the time of treatment in June 2020. A Singaporean girl, Kristal Yong, 12, is the second child to receive the internal radiation therapy for her cancer treatment, which took place last year (see separate report below). She also had rhabdomyosarcoma, but in her case, the tumour was in her right eye socket (called orbital rhabdomyosarcoma). Both Hai Dang and Kristal are patients at KKH. The hospital sees around 100 cases of childhood cancers each year, of which two to three cases are rhabdomyosarcomas. Due to the complexity of Hai Dang's and Kristal's illnesses, their treatments were planned and carried out by multidisciplinary teams from public healthcare group SingHealth, including KKH, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore General Hospital and Singapore National Eye Centre. Evidently, there was some hesitancy at first for the parents. ""We were very worried because there had never been a case like Hai Dang before for this treatment in Singapore,"" Mdm Nguyen said, but she and her husband decided on interstitial brachytherapy because the internal radiation method would target the tumour directly, and there would be fewer side effects than conventional radiation. SPARING HEALTHY TISSUE At a media briefing on June 21, Associate Professor Joyce Lam Ching Mei, a senior consultant at KKH's haematology-oncology service, said that an advantage of using the internal radiation method is that the patient's surrounding healthy tissue is spared the side effects of radiation. ""Traditionally, interstitial brachytherapy is performed on adult patients with prostate cancer or gynaecological cancers of the breast or cervix. But in highly experienced tertiary centres, brachytherapy is sometimes used on children,"" she said. Assoc Prof Lam explained that due to the location of Hai Dang's tumour in the prostate, the team devised the treatment plan in the hopes of preserving the child's fertility while maintaining quality of life, as well as reducing the long-term impact on urinary function. Mdm Nguyen said that the other proposed treatment option -involving surgery to remove the bladder - would severely affect her son's quality of life. ""It made sense for us to try (interstitial brachytherapy) before deciding to remove the entire bladder because it would affect his quality of life later on, especially when Hai Dang is so young,"" she added. Dr Amos Loh from KKH, who is one of the doctors caring for Hai Dang, explained that the child would not be able to urinate normally if the bladder was surgically removed. The senior consultant from the department of paediatric surgery explained: ""He would require surgical reconstruction of a neobladder, which is a fabricated bladder fashioned from his own intestine, to store urine. (The urine) would then flow out via an opening on the abdominal wall. ""Often, also, erectile function is affected due to the erectile nerves being removed as part of surgery to remove the bladder."" To preserve Hai Dang's reproductive functions from the harmful effects of radiation exposure, Assoc Prof Lam explained that the surgical team temporarily relocated the boy's testicles ""as far away as possible"" to the thigh area before radiation was delivered directly into the tumour. Dr Amos Loh said: ""The boy's testicles were moved back to the normal position in the scrotum, after his cancer treatment was completed. The surgery is unique to our paediatric oncology patients and not commonly performed."" The way in which interstitial brachytherapy is carried out can be daunting and frightening even for adult patients. The catheters that deliver the radiation to the tumour are placed and temporarily stay in the patient's body during their inpatient treatment. After a surgery to relocate his testes to the thigh, Hai Dang had 10 brachytherapy rods (or catheters) inserted - under general anaesthesia - into his tumour and left there for the entire duration of the treatment over five days. To prevent the catheters from dislodging, the child's hips were immobilised in a cast. Dr Enrica Tan, senior consultant at KKH's haematology-oncology service, who is also on Hai Dang's care team, said that painkillers such as paracetamol and morphine were given to help relieve pain and discomfort. Hai Dang's parents were heartbroken to hear their baby crying during his treatments to express his pain and discomfort. ""He cried a lot,"" Mdm Nguyen recalled. ""I also do not know how I made it through (the difficult days). It's all thanks to the love I have for my child."" His parents were counselled before the procedure to help them anticipate the caregiving needs. Dr Tan said: ""His mother who was the main caregiver was well-prepared and played a big role in soothing the child, helping to clean his perineum (the area between the anus and genitals) together with the nurses, deftly positioning herself to breastfeed him to comfort him while he was immobilised and lying down."" Over two years, Hai Dang's medical expenses came to about S$250,000, of which more than half was paid through money raised from crowdfunding, the Nguyens said, adding that they are thankful for the financial help. The sum was for bills paid to KKH and the initial chemotherapy treatments at NUH. Hai Dang will be back in Singapore at the end of the year for a check-up. There have been no active cancer cells detected after the treatment. Mdm Nguyen said that her son is now very active and likes watching cartoons and horsing around the playground. ""We hope he will always be healthy, grow up well and be happy by our side."" The second child to receive interstitial brachytherapy at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) for cancer treatment was Kristal Yong. However, her case is the first time that interstitial brachytherapy is performed in a child with orbital rhabdomyosarcoma in Southeast Asia and Singapore. Kristal's cancer was discovered after her parents noticed a small pimple-like but painless swelling near her eye. Her mother, Madam Lim Hwee Ping recalled that she had to agonise over whether to let her daughter undergo interstitial brachytherapy or go for the more conventional external radiation method. The 43-year-old homemaker said: ""To be honest, we were not keen (at first). Our main concern was, was it safe for her?"" ""Second, was the team confident enough to do it because we didn't want her to be a guinea pig. ""An experiment can fail, you can do another experiment, but she has only that one chance. I only have one daughter."" Mdm Lim said that they finally decided to choose interstitial brachytherapy. ""We just want her to have the best chance in life because she has a long runway,"" the mother said, adding that the doctors' dedication to Kristal's case gave her and her husband the confidence to go ahead with their decision. In Kristal's case, Assoc Prof Lam said that interstitial brachytherapy was proposed because its advantage of reducing complications to surrounding normal tissue is crucial in preserving the child's sight. Clinical Assistant Professor Kiattisa Sommat from National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) said that this ""concentrated way"" of delivering radiation to a tumour would also minimise the risk of the patient developing a second cancer due to radiation exposure of normal tissue. Assistant Prof Kiattisa is a senior consultant at NCCS' division of radiation oncology and one of the doctors involved in Kristal's treatment and care. She added that interstitial brachytherapy is not widely available now because it requires a level of technical skills to place the radiation source into the area of treatment. The cost is dependent on the site of treatment. When asked about the risks of interstitial therapy, Asst Prof Kiattisa said one of the things that could ""go wrong"" is during the process of inserting the brachytherapy catheters, which requires precision control. ""A difference of a few millimetres may mean injuring the optic nerve,"" she said, referring to Kristal's case. Kristal's mother recalled breaking down in tears after seeing the brachytherapy catheters in her daughter's eye for the first time in February last year. She had six plastic catheters inserted into the tumour in her right eye. For a week, radiation doses were delivered at fixed times of the day. ""I was too shocked. I already mentally prepared (myself) but when I saw my daughter, I couldn't take it. I just cried until I could accept it,"" Mdm Lim said. To avoid causing distress to Kristal, the medical team taped up mirrors in her room. However, as the days went by, Mdm Lim said that she ""got used"" to seeing the catheters sticking out of her child's eye. Kristal's ability to adapt to the strange situation also made her feel more at peace. ""Kids tend to be more resilient than what we think they are,"" the mother said. The girl, who had shown bravery and maturity beyond her years throughout her cancer ordeal, played games on her iPad while being confined to the hospital bed.

235,"Biotech firm begins study for blood test which detects cancers early; Test is first to use unique combination of indicators to screen for multiple cancers
The Straits Times (Singapore)
July 8, 2022 Friday","A home-grown biotech company has begun a large-scale clinical study for a blood test that can offer early screening of up to nine different cancers that have high mortality rates.
 The test by Mirxes uses a combination of biomarkers to screen for lung, breast, colorectal, liver, stomach (gastric), oesophageal, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers.
 Biomarkers are molecules or characteristics present in the body which can indicate diseases such as cancer. These include nucleic acids such as DNA or various types of RNA, proteins or chemical changes to these molecules such as methylation.
 The test is the first in the world to use this unique combination of blood-borne circulating microRNA (miRNA) and DNA methylation biomarkers to detect multiple cancers.
 Early detection of cancer is critical for patient survival. For example, a patient diagnosed with early stage lung cancer has a more than 80 per cent chance of survival compared with just 10 per cent for patients diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer.
 Dr Zhou Lihan, co-founder and chief executive of Mirxes, said: ""The goal is simple: To move the stage of cancer diagnosis from stages 3 and 4 - which is often the case now - to stages 1 and 2, based on a single blood test. This will improve survival rates easily by 50 per cent and possibly cut down the actual treatment costs.""
 Called Project Cadence, the study will receive an investment of at least $50 million over a three-year period, and is expected to recruit more than 12,000 individuals in Singapore, Mirxes said in a media statement yesterday.
 There are also plans to expand recruitment overseas from countries such as the United States, China and Japan.
 The study will also create more than 80 new positions here in research, manufacturing and data science over the next three years.
 Singapore has seen a reduction in some types of cancer, such as lung cancer as smoking incidence falls.
 But other cancers continue to creep upwards in tandem with changes in lifestyle and the ageing population, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who was the guest of honour at the announcement ceremony yesterday.
 ""Despite this, the Singapore population is under-screening for cancer... We will try to correct this with Project Cadence,"" Mr Ong said.
 ""Hence, Project Cadence is well-aligned with Healthier SG. When we embarked on Healthier SG, we positioned it as shifting from acute care to preventive care. This can really happen in a big way because of technological advancements,"" he added.
 Healthier SG represents a nationwide shift away from the traditional emphasis on illness-based hospital care towards a focus on preventive care. It keeps a lid on rising healthcare costs by tackling the problem at its roots, keeping people healthy for longer so they require less medical care.
 ""You can imagine that, in the future, genome sequencing will allow us to identify segments of society who may be slightly more susceptible to certain diseases, and very early interventions can take place. Simple interventions - exercise, diet - can be done because we can identify early who is more susceptible to certain chronic illnesses,"" Mr Ong said.
 Yesterday, he witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Mirxes and the National Cancer Centre Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, National University Hospital, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium, Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.
 The MOU creates a new public-private partnership to address the rising incidence of cancer here and the cost savings that would arise from early cancer detection.
 The research is expected to recruit more than 12,000 individuals, including healthy average-risk individuals, high-risk individuals, patients with benign conditions and newly diagnosed patients who have not received cancer treatment before. It also expects to produce a significant number of intellectual property rights created on single-and multi-cancer biomarkers and test kits.
 The intellectual property rights will be shared by Mirxes, the institutes of higher learning and public healthcare institutions, and the resulting blood test kits will be prototyped, manufactured and commercialised by Mirxes.
 Professor Yeoh Khay Guan, lead principal investigator for the project, said: ""Success in this venture would produce a game changer and a major breakthrough, a first of its kind blood test that can accurately detect early cancers and save many lives.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),7-07-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999983834256078}",en,0.9999983834256078
236,"PAP must keep renewing, stay vigorous and in touch with S'poreans: PM Lee
The Straits Times (Singapore)
July 13, 2022 Wednesday","The People's Action Party (PAP) must keep itself renewed, vigorous and in touch with the ground if it hopes to continue serving Singaporeans and Singapore for many years to come, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
 This is especially so given today's challenging times, he said yesterday at the PAP's appreciation dinner for its MPs who retired at the last general election.
 Thanking the 20 MPs who retired in 2020, PM Lee said the PAP continues to need new generations of people to come forward, enter the political arena and fight for the support of Singaporeans.
 Such men and women must possess not only integrity, commitment and ability, but also ""the grit to take the rough and tumble of politics, and the passion and imagination to build a better Singapore"", said PM Lee, who is also the party's secretary-general.
 As he paid tribute to the retired MPs for their various community activities and constituency projects that have benefited their residents, PM Lee said most important was their political work to mobilise support for the PAP and win votes in elections.
 ""We must never do things solely for political advantage, but unless good policies and good work translate into votes and electoral success, they cannot endure,"" he told attendees at the dinner held at Parliament House.
 Addressing the 100-strong audience, which included current MPs and the party's branch chairs, PM Lee quelled the notion that PAP MPs are all cut from the same cloth.
 ""Some think that since PAP MPs all wear white and white, they are also monochrome in their ideas and perspectives,"" he said. ""But this view is quite mistaken.""
 In fact, the PAP does its utmost to field a diverse team at each election and ensures that every MP brings something different to the table, which help make the Government's policies more rounded and robust, he added.
 ""We must maintain this diversity in our ranks, keep our party a broad tent, and field the best possible team in the next general election,"" he said. ""And that work is under way.""
 PM Lee also presented valedictory letters to 13 of the 20 retired MPs. They are Mr Ang Hin Kee, Mr Cedric Foo, Mr Charles Chong, Dr Chia Shi-Lu, Professor Fatimah Lateef, Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar, Ms Lee Bee Wah, Mr Lee Yi Shyan, Dr Lily Neo, Mr Ong Teng Koon, Dr Teo Ho Pin, Mr Yee Chia Hsing and Mr Zainal Sapari.
 The other seven - Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, Mr Khaw Boon Wan, Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Mr Lim Swee Say, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, Mr Teo Ser Luck and Mr Sam Tan - had already received their letters when they stepped down from political office.
 The longest-serving of the 20 retired MPs is ESM Goh, who had served 10 terms since 1977, followed by Mr Charles Chong, who had served seven terms since 1989.
 PM Lee said he was grateful that the outgoing MPs appreciated the need for the PAP to keep up leadership renewal and to make sure that Singapore always has the strongest team to lead it. He thanked them for making way for their successors, and for guiding and supporting them.
 Prof Fatimah, who was formerly MP for Marine Parade GRC and served for three terms, told The Straits Times that her time in politics taught her that serving patients and constituents has many evidence-based similarities.
 For instance, excellent communication was needed, just like for a doctor's bedside manner, and clinical reasoning was useful in solving problems for her residents, just as it is for diagnosing her patients.

237,"SGH to deploy AI-powered tool to ensure proper wearing of PPE; It can detect right and wrong movement during gown donning and doffing
The Straits Times (Singapore)
July 16, 2022 Saturday","A new digital tool to ensure healthcare workers and visitors entering high-risk wards are wearing their personal protective equipment (PPE) properly will be deployed at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) within the next two months.
 The first of its kind here, the tool, called Blue Mirror PPE Instructor, is powered by artificial intelligence.
 In 2020, Ms Ang Shin Yuh, deputy director of the nursing division at SGH, suggested the idea of using technology to ensure that PPE is worn properly.
 At the time, nurses were deployed to a community care facility at Singapore Expo to care for migrant workers who had Covid-19, and they had to manually check one another's PPE using mirrors before entering the place.
 Ms Bushra Shaik Ismail, a nurse clinician at the infection prevention and epidemiology department at SGH, said nurses had to spend almost a whole day teaching about 30 non-healthcare workers the proper way of donning PPE.
 To ensure the health and safety of nurses and to allow them to focus on patient care, SGH partnered Blue Mirror, a New Zealand-based health tech company, in November last year to customise its PPE Instructor for use at the hospital.
 The customised software, which was validated with about 200 staff and visitors, can detect the right and wrong movements during gown donning and doffing.
 It will be deployed in an isolation ward, a multi-drug-resistant organism ward that allows visits and the training department at SGH.
 It is installed on iPads or tablets that can be mounted on a tripod or any flat surface.
 The customised solution comprises three modes.
 The buddy mode helps to check healthcare workers' PPE.
 The training mode provides one-on-one sessions for new staff, who can practise at any time without the need for a human trainer.
 Visitors will learn to wear the PPE at a pace slower than that for the training mode and can refer to step-by-step instructions on the tablet.
 Through audio prompts and pictorial guides, the tool will alert staff and visitors if they are wearing equipment such as gloves and gowns incorrectly. It can also track healthcare workers' compliance with the hospital's PPE protocols.
 Said Ms Ang: ""The solution can also be further customised for disease-specific protocol, contact tracing purposes and image recognition for staff access in the future.
 ""This will put us in the best possible position when the next pandemic hits.""",The Straits Times (Singapore),15-07-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999955143038751}",en,0.9999955143038751
238,"&#039;Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned&#039;: Woman loses negligence lawsuit against psychiatrist ex-lover
Today (Singapore) - Online
July 19, 2022 Tuesday","SINGAPORE - A woman who had an extramarital affair with her psychiatrist has failed in her lawsuit against him, after she sued him for negligence for allegedly getting her hooked on pills to manage her anxiety. High Court judge Tan Siong Thye on Tuesday (July 19) described Ms Serene Tiong Sze Yin's lawsuit as her ""latest episode in her plot for revenge"" against Dr Chan Herng Nieng. In dismissing Ms Tiong's claims for S$250,000 in damages for medical negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress, Justice Tan found her testimony to be highly unreliable and that her claims were an abuse of process. Tuesday's ruling was the latest in a string of legal disputes arising from Ms Tiong's affair with Dr Chan. The psychiatrist and Ms Tiong, a senior business development manager at Precious Medical Centre, began their affair in January 2017. She was still married while he was not. 
Dr Chan, who runs his own private practice at Capital Mindhealth Clinic, gave Ms Tiong Xanax tablets for her anxiety during their relationship. The pair broke up around May 2018 after Ms Tiong found explicit WhatsApp messages between Dr Chan and his close friend, colorectal surgeon Julian Ong. Both doctors boasted about their sexual exploits with other married women. Ms Tiong lodged a complaint with the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) and emailed her complaint to other doctors, writing that Dr Chan and Dr Ong were colluding to take advantage of vulnerable female patients. Dr Ong then sued her for defamation. He lost and lodged an appeal with the High Court. In October 2020, High Court judge See Kee Oon found that both men did not collude to take sexual advantage of Ms Tiong, but said that they could have come together to target a female patient of Dr Ong's. Despite ruling in Dr Ong's favour, Justice See cautioned that he and Dr Chan had ""no moral victory"" to claim and chided them for their blatant treatment of women as sex objects. Justice Tan echoed this on Tuesday, writing in his 104-page grounds of decision that Dr Chan's exploitation of Ms Tiong and other women ""for his own perverse desires is debauched, degenerate and highly deserving of censure"". The judge added that there was ""no true winner"" in the long-running saga. CHANGED EVIDENCE TO FIT HER CASE In her current negligence lawsuit against Dr Chan, Ms Tiong claimed that he gave her an addictive drug and that he told her he was committed to a long-term and exclusive sexual relationship with her. She also alleged that she suffered a ""mental and emotional breakdown"" when she discovered his relationships with other women. She argued that as her de facto doctor, Dr Chan owed her a duty of care to ensure that she would not become addicted to Xanax. Ms Tiong also claimed to have suffered side effects from the alleged high dosages of drugs given to her, which was evident in how she confronted him at his clinic in front of employees and patients in June 2018. In his defence, Dr Chan argued that other psychiatrists continued to prescribe Xanax to Ms Tiong after they broke up and their communications did not support her assertion that she suffered side effects from taking the drug. The key issues during the trial included how many tablets Dr Chan had given to Ms Tiong and how frequently he gave her the tablets. She asserted that he gave her 280 or 330 tablets from February 2017 to May 2018, while he said that he gave her just 14 tablets for short-term use in May 2018. Justice Tan found Dr Chan's version of events to be more credible, ruling that Ms Tiong's evidence on this ""crucial pillar"" of the case was ""gravely inconsistent and irreconcilable"". Ms Tiong ""vacillated repeatedly"" on how many Xanax tablets Dr Chan gave her, Justice Tan found. Contemporaneous records from Singapore General Hospital also refuted her claim that Dr Chan gave her 160 tablets from May 2017 to March 2018. Ms Tiong later claimed that these inconsistencies were due to memory impairment or loss due to her Xanax consumption. Justice Tan described this explanation as a ""double-edged sword"" because it suggested that her recollection of events and court testimony were unreliable. Given that the number of Xanax tablets was the heart of her claim for medical negligence, the judge said that her conflicting evidence proved fatal and spoke volumes about her reliability as witness. Justice Tan wrote: ""At one point, Ms Tiong herself seemed aware of the persistently conflicting nature of her evidence, agreeing during cross-examination that she was re-engineering her evidence on the quantity of Xanax to fit her case."" NO BREACH OF CARE Justice Tan then found that as a result, Dr Chan did not breach his duty of care to Ms Tiong. The judge also rubbished her claim that she suffered from Xanax dependency. Another medical expert testified that the risk of physical dependency on the drug was very low, even if Dr Chan had prescribed the highest quantity of Xanax - about two to three tablets a week from February 2017 to March 2018. The expert further refuted Ms Tiong's claims that she suffered adverse side effects after more than a year of consuming Xanax. The expert said that such side effects would last only four to five hours. Justice Tan also accepted Dr Chan's lawyers' argument that in any case, no reasonable psychiatrist would have continued prescribing the drug to her if she had side effects. On another point, he noted that Ms Tiong was willing to continue a long-term relationship with Dr Chan if he pledged to marry her. This meant that the harm she purportedly suffered from in realising that he did not intend to have a long-term, exclusive relationship with her was, at best, minimal. As for the amount of losses, Justice Tan said that Ms Tiong's lawyer belatedly raised that Dr Chan was liable for S$250,000 worth of damages, on the basis that she requires lifelong treatment for Xanax addiction. She had failed to prove that she suffered harm of this amount as a result of Dr Chan's prescription. The case should not have been heard in the High Court, which has a minimum civil jurisdiction of S$250,000, the judge added. NO TRUE WINNER The High Court judge also agreed with the Court of Appeal's findings in August 2020 that Ms Tiong was ""clearly on a quest for revenge"". The apex court had dismissed her lawsuit against the chief executive officer of HC Surgical Specialists for breaching his duties as a company director by acquiring a stake in Dr Ong's private clinic. Justice Tan wrote: ""In my view, Ms Tiong displayed a willing readiness to compromise the court process for her own personal vendetta... She even admitted that she had not calculated the precise number of Xanax tablets provided to her before filing her claim for medical negligence and only did so the night before the third day of the trial. ""The final death knell came when Ms Tiong affirmed that she would not have commenced the present suit if she were in a relationship with Dr Chan."" All in all, this still did not excuse or vindicate Dr Chan's behaviour, Justice Tan said. The psychiatrist is now appealing against a decision by SMC to suspend him from medical practice for five months from February this year. Justice Tan said: ""Dr Chan's disgraceful use of women, including Ms Tiong, as his sex objects and the disturbing pride with which he gloated about his sexual conquests in the WhatsApp exchanges with Dr Ong suggest that he is a person with serious and grave character defects. ""Dr Chan's conduct in exploiting Ms Tiong and other women for his own perverse desires is debauched, degenerate and highly deserving of censure."" The judge added: ""Indeed, the adage that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned best describes the vitriolic actions of Ms Tiong. This case is the latest episode in Ms Tiong's plot for revenge against the one who spurned her."" When Dr Chan wanted to end the relationship, Ms Tiong had demanded a branded Cartier watch and S$150,000 from Dr Chan. He then reported her to the police for extortion. The police issued Ms Tiong a written warning in lieu of prosecution for attempted extortion in January 2020. Justice Tan noted: ""Ultimately, no true winner has emerged from this entire debacle. ""Although I have ruled against Ms Tiong, Dr Chan has borne, and will continue to bear, the shame of having his wanton and depraved behaviour aired in public for all to see."" Ms Tiong was represented by lawyer Ong Ying Ping, while Dr Chan was defended by a legal team - Ms Rebecca Chew, Mr Darren Lim and Mr Benedict Tedjopranoto - from Rajah and Tann.",Today (Singapore) - Online,19-07-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999981733055641}",en,0.9999981733055641
239,"How much do you know about hepatitis B and what if you're a silent 'carrier' of the virus?
Today (Singapore) - Online
July 23, 2022 Saturday","SINGAPORE - Hepatitis B affects about one in 25 people in Singapore, but more than half of the population here do not know that viral hepatitis can cause liver failure. More than half are also unaware that the infection can be spread through unprotected sex, a doctor who has done research on the disease told TODAY. In Singapore, hepatitis B is the most common cause of long-term, chronic viral hepatitis, a term used to describe inflammation of the liver. Despite being able to cause serious life-threatening health problems, awareness of viral hepatitis remains low, especially among younger people aged 25 and below. Many mistakenly believe that hepatitis B is transmitted by eating contaminated raw seafood, for instance. 
Professor Tan Chee Kiat, senior consultant with the department of gastroenterology and hepatology at Singapore General Hospital (SGH), said that Singapore and the Asia region are particularly vulnerable to the infection and liver disease because hepatitis B is endemic in the region. This means the virus circulates and causes infections regularly. Prof Tan is the co-author of the Asia Pacific Liver Index Study, which was commissioned by biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences across 11 countries and territories in Asia in 2020, including Singapore. He said that hepatitis is often dubbed a ""silent killer"". ""People with viral hepatitis often experience no obvious symptoms until the infection causes serious health implications. This may cause many people to fall victim to the disease."" Ahead of World Hepatitis Day on July 28, experts shed light on the most common cause of viral hepatitis here, how it spreads and what asymptomatic carriers can do to protect themselves and others. WHY IS VIRAL HEPATITIS SERIOUS? There are five main hepatitis viruses: Types A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis A and hepatitis E are usually short-term infections. Hepatitis A, for instance, is spread through contaminated food and is usually passed out of the body after some months without long-lasting health problems. Hepatitis B and C can become chronic, lead to liver damage and are associated with liver cancer. In 2015, there was a hepatitis C outbreak in SGH that affected 25 patients, of whom eight died - with the disease likely contributing to the deaths of seven. Disciplinary action was later taken against Ministry of Health officials and SGH staff members for not doing enough and failing to recognise how serious was the situation and the lapses in infection controls. It is hepatitis B, though, that is the most common cause of chronic viral hepatitis. A recent study here showed that more than half of 3,000 liver cancer cases in three major public hospitals in Singapore were due to hepatitis B infection, Prof Tan said. This liver infection can also lead to permanent scarring and hardening of the liver, liver failure and long-term inflammation. Hepatitis D, which occurs only in people with hepatitis B infection, is also associated with liver cancer. LIVER TRANSPLANTS NEEDED IN SOME CASES Some of the most severe cases that Prof Tan has seen involve younger adults. ""They have a flare-up of their hepatitis B disease, which is so bad that they need urgent life-saving liver transplantation,"" he said. There are also some patients who develop liver cancer. ""The majority of these patients either do not bother to follow up with their doctors even though they are aware that they have hepatitis B or were not aware that they have hepatitis B until the serious complication (such as liver cirrhosis and liver cancer) occurred,"" he added. HOW IT IS SPREAD Associate Professor George Goh, chairperson of the National Foundation of Digestive Diseases, said that in Singapore, the hepatitis B virus is most commonly spread from an infected mother to a child during birth. However, this mode of transmission will become less common over time. This is due to the increasing prevalence of vaccination as well as routine vaccination against hepatitis B of all newborns, Prof Tan explained. Assoc Prof Goh, who is also a senior consultant at SGH's department of gastroentrology and hepatology, said that people in Singapore with the infection are largely those who missed the nationwide childhood immunisation, which started in 1987. Hepatitis B vaccination is included in the Singapore National Childhood Immunisation Schedule, where all children should receive three doses at appropriate intervals. Hepatitis B can be transmitted through body secretions such as blood and semen, similar to that of the human immunodeficiency virus, Prof Tan said. A person can get the virus through unprotected sex with an infected person or blood transfusions. Prof Tan said that another route of transmission is via contaminated needles or sharp instruments used during acupuncture, tattooing, ear piercing and manicures, for example. ""While hepatitis B is prevalent in the Asia region, people can protect themselves against the virus during overseas travel by being vaccinated (against hepatitis B) and taking precautionary measures such as using condoms, and not sharing needles for piercings, tattoos and injecting drugs,"" he added. ""The mode of hepatitis B transmission is the same regardless of where one travels or where one is. It is not the travel itself that transmits hepatitis B, but rather the individual's behaviour when overseas."" AN INFECTED PERSON MAY HAVE NO SYMPTOMS Viral hepatitis B can develop as an acute infection or become a chronic condition. Assoc Prof Goh explained: ""When first infected, it is considered an acute or new infection. If the person is not able to get rid of the virus beyond six months, he or she is considered to have chronic hepatitis B infection."" The age in which the person is exposed to the virus matters. ""The younger the person when he or she is first infected, the greater the risk of developing chronic hepatitis B infection,"" Assoc Prof Goh said, adding that more than 90 per cent of infants infected would develop chronic hepatitis B. By contrast, only 5 to 10 per cent of adults would develop chronic hepatitis B, with the majority of adults recovering from the acute infection. For those with symptoms, there may be jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyeballs. They may also have dark tea-coloured urine, nausea, loss of appetite and vomiting, prolonged tiredness, fever and abdominal pain. Assoc Prof Goh said that most people with chronic hepatitis B are asymptomatic or have no symptoms. They are known as ""carriers"" and can go about their daily activities without any problems. The down side is, this makes the virus difficult to detect. ""It may also give a false sense of security that everything is fine,"" he added. ""Patients with hepatitis B, even those without any symptoms, may be at risk of serious medical complications (such as liver damage)."" Assoc Prof Goh said that a routine blood test would be the hepatitis B surface antigen test. If positive, it would signify hepatitis B infection. If this is persistent over more than six months, it would be considered chronic hepatitis B. VACCINATION AVAILABLE FOR ADULTS The hepatitis B vaccination is also included in Singapore's National Adult Immunisation Schedule, whereby individuals aged 18 years or older who have not been vaccinated before or lack evidence of past infection or immunity should receive it. The vaccine has to be taken in three doses. ""The vaccine is safe and extremely effective if individuals complete all three doses at appropriate intervals,"" Assoc Prof Goh said. However, the thing to note is that the hepatitis B vaccine is effective only for people who have not been infected with the hepatitis B virus, he pointed out. This means that the vaccine is not recommended for hepatitis B carriers. ""Instead, it is recommended that people who have been infected visit their medical professionals to learn more about the best treatments for controlling the virus and precautionary measures to take to protect their loved ones and people around them."" PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID SPREAD To avoid transmitting it to other people, Prof Tan from SGH advised the following precautionary measures for hepatitis B carriers: Avoid donating blood, blood products, organs and sperm Avoid sharing toothbrush, shaving equipment Household contacts and sexual partners of carriers should be screened and immunised against hepatitis B if they are not vaccinated Female carriers who are pregnant should have her child vaccinated at birth Assoc Prof Goh said that all pregnant mothers are tested during pregnancy to identify those with chronic hepatitis B, who are at risk of transmitting the virus to their baby. Pregnant mothers who know they have hepatitis B should inform their doctor of their status. Their doctor will assess whether treatment is warranted during the pregnancy to reduce the risk of transmission to their baby. Infants born to mothers with hepatitis B are also recommended to receive hepatitis B vaccination and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (containing antibodies against the hepatitis B virus) at birth, Assoc Prof Goh added. For those who are considering getting their vaccine shots, he said that there is limited information for now on administering Covid-19 vaccines at the same time as other non-Covid-19 vaccines. ""As recommended by the Ministry of Health, a minimum interval of 14 days is encouraged before or after any other vaccines, but is not strictly necessary,"" he added. IS THERE A CURE? Although vaccination can prevent hepatitis B, there is no cure for it, Prof Tan said. The doctors said that once diagnosed, there should be regular active monitoring. This is done via blood tests and liver scans to determine if treatment is necessary. Assoc Prof Goh said that typically, it would be a half-yearly blood test and a liver ultrasound done every six months to one year, but this would depend on the individual patient and subject to the attending doctor's discretion. Prof Tan said: ""Treatment can help control the virus, delay or possibly reverse liver damage and reduce the risk of other complications such as liver failure and liver cancer."" In the Singapore Liver Index Study published last year, a substantial proportion (70 per cent) of people diagnosed with liver disease are not on treatment, saying that cost was a factor or they preferred Traditional Chinese Medicine over Western medicine. Prof Tan said that based on Western literature, there is no Traditional Chinese Medicine known to be effective in treating hepatitis B. WHAT ABOUT THE RECENT ACUTE HEPATITIS AFFECTING CHILDREN? As of July 8, 35 countries have reported 1,010 probable cases of severe acute hepatitis of an ""unknown"" origin in children aged 16 or younger, including 22 deaths, the World Health Organization said earlier this month. Since the outbreak was first reported in the United Kingdom in early April, similar cases have been reported in Europe and Asia. However, the health authorities around the world are still investigating the cause of the liver inflammation. Laboratory testing excluded the hepatitis A to E viruses in these children. Health officials have said that the adenovirus (a common virus affecting children) is the most frequently detected pathogen among the cases. Assoc Prof Goh said that some of the symptoms reported are similar to that of the hepatitis viruses A, B and C - such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea and vomiting - but most of the children did not have a fever. In Singapore, three cases of acute hepatitis of an ""indeterminate"" cause have been reported. The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced the first domestic case, a 10-month-old infant, on April 30. A three-year-old and eight-year-old were also identified to have developed the illness in October and November last year respectively, after MOH conducted a look-back investigation. In a May 31 statement released by MOH, it was stated that hepatitis in young children is ""not uncommon"" and it is not unusual for the cause of some hepatitis cases in children to remain unknown. Although the cause of hepatitis in all three children here has not been identified, it may not mean that these cases are linked to the global outbreak, MOH added.",Today (Singapore) - Online,25-07-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999957862944593}",en,0.9999957862944593
240,"Singapore reports 9th case of monkeypox
Channel NewsAsia
July 25, 2022 Monday 10:08 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported one more case of monkeypox infection on Monday (Jul 25), bringing the total number of infections in the country since June to nine.
The patient is a 31-year-old Filipino man, said MOH in an update on its website.
He tested positive for the virus on Monday, four days after developing a fever on Jul 21. He also had rashes on his face and other parts of his body, said MOH.
The man sought medical attention at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Sunday and was admitted the same day, added the ministry.
He is in stable condition and contact tracing is ongoing.
The man's infection is not linked to any of the earlier monkeypox cases, said the Health Ministry.
Monkeypox is a viral disease that is typically self-limiting, with patients recovering within 14 to 21 days.
Those who are infected usually experience fever, headache, muscle ache, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, lethargy and rash.
Of the nine monkeypox cases announced in Singapore since June, four are imported and the five are local. None of the cases so far are linked.
On Monday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that MOH does not recommend the mass vaccination of Singapore's population against monkeypox, reiterating the ministry's stance on the viral disease.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Saturday declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. INITIAL: vc",Channel NewsAsia,26-07-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999967009625865}",en,0.9999967009625865
241,"Thyroid disease: Women are 5 times more likely to get it than men - here's how to spot the signs
Channel NewsAsia
July 25, 2022 Monday 6:40 AM GMT","Five years ago, when she was a 21-year-old student, Lee Mun Ling came down with a niggling flu that wouldn't go away - a rare occurrence as she seldom fell sick.
At the hospital, the doctors suspected dengue fever and so a blood test was carried out. The results were negative for dengue, but they uncovered other problems.
For one, her blood pressure was sky-high even though she had no heart disease. Also, her heart rate was through the roof. Alarmed, the doctors put her in the trauma ward and performed more tests.
Lee said: ""Eventually, they told me I had hyperthyroid caused by Graves' disease, an autoimmune condition.""
After two years of daily oral medication to control her over-active thyroid, she was healthy for a year. But then she had a relapse.
""The medication failed to fix the problem the second time round. And so the doctors suggested radioactive iodine treatment, which is basically to kill the thyroid gland,"" she said. WHAT IS THYROID DISORDER?
Dr Kathleen Sek, an endocrinology consultant with National University Hospital as well as the Fast and Chronic programmes at Alexandra Hospital, explained that the thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ located at the base of the neck. It makes, stores and releases thyroid hormones into the blood, hence regulating metabolism.
""Thyroid hormones influence how fast the body produces and uses energy. Your brain, heart, blood vessels, liver, muscles, skin and reproductive system all require thyroid hormones to function normally,"" she said.
A disorder can occur when there is an abnormality in the gland's structure, such as a growth, or in the amount of hormones it secretes. Though thyroid disorder can take different forms, Dr Sek said the two most common ones are hyperthyroidism - where the thyroid gland releases too much thyroid hormones - and hypothyroidism, where it doesn't produce enough of it.
Between the two types of disorders, she felt hypothyroidism is likely more common - an observation shared by Dr Adoree Lim, an endocrinology consultant at Singapore General Hospital.
""We do not have local data on the prevalence of all thyroid conditions in Singapore. However, we expect them to be similar to that in many other parts of the world,"" said Dr Lim.
In the United States, said Dr Sek, it is estimated that 1.2 per cent of the population have hyperthyroidism, while up to 5 per cent have hypothyroidism.
THE CAUSES OF THYROID DISORDER
There are various triggers for thyroid disorder, the most common of which, said Dr Sek, are autoimmune disorders.
""Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system produces antibodies against normal tissue in the body. It is not known why this happens, but there appears to be a genetic link, and thyroid disorders commonly run in the family,"" she said. Dr Lim explained that hypothyroidism is often due to the autoimmune disorder known as Hashimoto's disease, while hyperthyroidism results from Graves' disease.
She said: ""With Hashimoto's disease, antibodies produced by our own white blood cells target the thyroid gland, gradually destroying its ability to produce thyroid hormone.
""As for Grave's disease, the antibodies overstimulate the thyroid gland, causing it to produce too much thyroid hormone.""
WOMEN ARE MORE AT RISK: THYROID DISEASE SYMPTOMS TO WATCH FOR
Although thyroid conditions can occur in both men and women of all ages, Dr Sek said women are five times more likely to get thyroid disorders compared to men. In addition, hyperthyroidism more commonly afflicts younger women.
Signs of hyperthyroidism include weight loss despite a good appetite, often feeling hot or anxious, a fast pulse, tremors, and frequent bowel movements. Baddariah binte Mohd Karim, a 42-year-old mother-of-three, recounted experiencing these exact symptoms barely a year after the birth of her third child.
""My hands trembled all the time, I was sweating a lot, passing motion often and losing weight. Because my heart was beating so fast, I had difficulty sleeping, which then resulted in fatigue. When my blood test results came back, they showed my thyroid level was seven times higher than normal,"" she said.
Hypothyroidism has the opposite symptoms. The body's metabolism slows down and individuals may put on weight despite a reduced appetite, feel cold and tired, or be constipated. They may also experience dry skin, hair loss and leg cramps.
In addition to all the above symptoms, which are common to both genders, Dr Sek said women may also experience abnormal menstrual periods, have difficulty conceiving or have recurrent miscarriages.
You may also notice swelling or a lump in your neck, which could be a sign of both hyper- and hypothyroidism - although doctors would also look out for other symptoms such as tremors, and weight and appetite changes in the diagnosis. However, Dr Lim noted that many of these signs are not specific to thyroid disorder and may be experienced by otherwise normal individuals.
""The best way to diagnose both hyper- and hypothyroidism is by performing a blood test which measures the levels of the thyroid hormone and the antibody known as TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone),"" she advised.
Such was the case for 44-year-old Celine Tan, who had a bout of mild hypothyroidism in her early twenties.
""I was lethargic and had slight hair thinning and weight gain. But the symptoms were mild so it was almost impossible to guess the problem. They were also very generic and could be due to other ailments,"" she said.
Thinking it wasn't serious, she didn't see a doctor.
""It was only when I was in Canada for a student exchange that I went to the university doctors because I was feeling so out of sorts. They quickly diagnosed that I had thyroid issues,"" said Tan. HOW THYROID DISEASE IS TREATED
Dr Lim said there are three main ways of treating hyperthyroidism: Oral medication, radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy, or thyroid surgery. All three methods work to decrease the production of thyroid hormones.
She elaborated: ""During RAI therapy, a small dose of radioactive iodine is ingested and absorbed by thyroid cells - the only cells in our body that take up iodine. The radioactivity destroys the thyroid cells slowly over time.""
Thyroid surgery involves removing most of the thyroid gland. Dr Lim explained that the treatment is recommended if the swelling of the gland is big and cosmetically unattractive for the patient. It is also used if there is a concern about cancer in the thyroid. For hypothyroidism, patients are treated with supplements of the thyroid hormone, thyroxine.
""This is given as a small pill daily, has very few side effects and almost no allergic reactions. Once the dose of thyroxine you require has been established, it is usually stable for life except during pregnancy,"" she said.
As low levels of thyroid hormone during pregnancy may harm the baby or cause miscarriages, the doctor will have to adjust the dosage of thyroxine.
THYROID DISORDER TREAMENT: KNOCK-ON EFFECTS AND IMPLICATIONS
Both Dr Sek and Dr Lim said that adverse effects from anti-thyroid medication are rare, though not unheard of. But it is long-term or untreated thyroid disorders that are the real causes for concern.
""Untreated hyperthyroidism can cause abnormal heart rhythms such as fast, irregular heart rate, heart failure in the long run, or a severe, dangerous form of hyperthyroidism known as a thyroid storm. It can also worsen osteoporosis,"" said Dr Lim. For women planning to have children, Dr Sek emphasised that it is essential to ensure normal thyroid function prior to conceiving.
She warned: ""Poorly controlled maternal hyperthyroidism is associated with miscarriage, pregnancy-induced hypertension, prematurity, low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, thyroid storm and maternal heart failure.""
Maternal hypothyroidism, too, needs to be well managed, she added. ""Otherwise, it has been linked to an increased risk of adverse pregnancy complications, such as premature birth, low birth weight, pregnancy loss and lower offspring intelligence quotient."" Even RAI treatment and thyroid surgery, while seeming to nip the problem of hyperthyroidism once and for all, can have wider implications.
Dr Lim said both these treatments carry the risk of causing hypothyroidism instead.
""This happens because too many thyroid cells are destroyed or most of the gland is removed, so there is insufficient thyroid hormone produced,"" she explained.
Although she said hypothyroidism is easily diagnosed and treated with thyroid hormone replacement, some patients do report difficulties during their adjustment period.
Baddariah said her metabolism became very low after RAI treatment, causing her to feel sluggish easily. She also experienced brain fog and mood swings.
Similarly, Lee said she felt unmotivated and had no energy to carry out many normal activities, while her yoyo-ing weight added to feelings of mild depression.
""Although the doctors did advise me of the potential side effects, I had a hard time adjusting after undergoing RAI therapy. I was under the impression the side effects would be mild, but they turned out more severe than I expected,"" she said.

242,"Vital to tackle manpower crunch to relieve burden on nurses: Ong; He stresses need to ensure nurses can sustain their work even as health system stays stable
The Straits Times (Singapore)
July 26, 2022 Tuesday","Singapore's healthcare system can still handle the patient load as Covid-19 infections peak, and it is important to tackle the manpower crunch to relieve the workload of nurses here.
 Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said this yesterday in his address at the Nurses' Day celebration of healthcare cluster SingHealth.
 ""How is the hospital situation? It's busy, but it's stable,"" he added.
 Singapore reported 6,175 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday and there were 738 Covid-19 patients in hospital.
 Acknowledging that Singapore has a very diverse group of nurses comprising both locals and foreigners, Mr Ong stressed the importance of continuing to tackle the problem of manpower shortage to relieve the burden on nurses.
 Addressing the 400 nurses at the event, he said: ""Nurses can still go on leave, which is not suspended... What is more important is we make sure everyone does not burn out. We make sure you are able to sustain your very important work.""
 He added: ""Please rest assured that every week I look at the attrition rates of all our hospital groups. We are stable and I hope we remain so throughout the year. But rest assured this is always our top priority.""
 SingHealth, which has more than 11,700 nurses, held its annual Nurses' Day celebration at Ngee Ann Kongsi Auditorium in Singapore General Hospital yesterday, ahead of Nurses' Day on Aug 1.
 Nursing awards were presented to 150 exemplary nurses who demonstrated excellence in their careers, as well as emerging nurse leaders who made enormous contributions towards improving the quality and standard of nursing care at SingHealth institutions.
 At the event, SingHealth also announced a $5 million gift from Wee Foundation for the health group's nurses.
 The money was used to set up the Wee Foundation Nursing Academic Fund, which supports scholarships for nurses to expand their knowledge and competencies.
 The scholarships will allow them to take up courses that lead to a graduate certificate, graduate diploma, master's degree or doctorate.
    AVOIDING BURNOUT  Nurses can still go on leave, which is not suspended... What is more important is we make sure everyone does not burn out. We make sure you are able to sustain your very important work.
 Please rest assured that every week I look at the attrition rates of all our hospital groups. We are stable and I hope we remain so throughout the year. But rest assured this is always our top priority.
    HEALTH MINISTER ONG YE KUNG, at SingHealth's Nurses' Day celebration.  The money will also allow nurses to pursue courses and training programmes in areas such as digitalisation, data analytics, systems and design thinking, and innovation.
 These skills will better prepare them for the future workplace where technology will feature more prominently in everyday work.
 This is the first time that Wee Foundation is gifting money to nurses.
 Ms Wee Wei Ling, director of the foundation, said: ""This gift reflects Wee Foundation's deep gratitude to this very special group of professionals who inspire us with their dedication to their vocation and their immense contributions, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.""
 One of the nurses who received an award yesterday was senior staff nurse Brendan Chew, 34, who works in the accident and emergency (A&E) department at Changi General Hospital.
 Mr Chew said he chose to specialise in emergency medicine because he thrives on the fast-paced work in the A&E department, which tends to be non-routine.
 He hopes to utilise his skills in humanitarian aid and medical missions in the future.

243,"3 more monkeypox cases bring total in Singapore to 9; MOH says most WHO-recommended steps including isolation rules in place since May
The Straits Times (Singapore)
July 26, 2022 Tuesday","A 31-year-old Filipino tested positive for monkeypox yesterday, the fifth such local case to date.
 This brings the total number of cases detected here to nine, comprising five local and four imported cases. None has been linked to another.
 In updates on monkeypox on its website, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said the man developed a fever last Thursday, and then rashes on his face and body.
 He sought medical care at Singapore General Hospital on Sunday and was admitted on the same day.
 His condition is stable, with contact tracing ongoing.
 This comes after two men - a 46-year-old male Estonian and a 26-year-old Singaporean male - tested positive for the disease on Sunday.
 Both were admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases and are in stable condition.
 The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Saturday declared monkeypox a global health emergency, with more than 16,000 cases confirmed in 70 countries and territories worldwide.
 It is the strongest call to action that the global organisation can make, signalling a new sense of urgency and the scale of a disease that had previously been primarily found in western and central Africa.
 Covid-19 was given the same label back in 2020.
 In a statement to The Straits Times on whether Singapore will change its domestic or border restrictions following the WHO's decision, MOH said the authorities have already put in place the majority of WHO-recommended monkeypox measures since May.
 These include protocols for isolating confirmed cases and quarantining close contacts for 21 days from the date of exposure.
 Lower-risk contacts are put on phone surveillance for 21 days, the maximum incubation period for the virus.
 MOH said the healthcare system has the expertise and capability to effectively test, diagnose and treat monkeypox infections. It has been engaging those who are more at risk, whom studies have shown are mostly men who have sex with men.
 Professor Roy Chan, founder and president of non-profit organisation Action for Aids, said it is important to raise awareness of the infection in the gay and bisexual community without making moral judgment, so that those who are infected feel safe to seek treatment when symptoms surface.
 He said: ""We don't want to stigmatise the disease, stigmatise the people who are potentially infected. Otherwise, it is driven underground and that is where the threat lies.""
 A study published in The New England Journal Of Medicine last week said transmission in 95 per cent of monkeypox cases was through sexual activity. The disease is, however, not a sexually transmitted infection in the traditional sense as it can also be passed via close physical contact.
 Professor Dale Fisher, who is on the WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, noted that the impact of monkeypox is unlikely to be on the same scale as that of Covid-19.
 Monkeypox is unlikely to impact international trade and is not overly lethal, with five deaths out of 16,000 cases, said Prof Fisher, a senior consultant at National University Hospital's division of infectious diseases.
 Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a Facebook post yesterday that each monkeypox case so far typically generates three to four close contacts who require quarantine - unlike Covid-19, which may generate up to 20 quarantine orders.
 The ministry is closely monitoring developments, he said.
 ""As of now, given the self-limiting nature of the disease, MOH does not recommend the mass vaccination of the whole population against monkeypox because the benefits do not outweigh the risk,"" he added.

Today (Singapore) - Online
July 26, 2022 Tuesday","SINGAPORE - While a group of friends were taking illicit drugs in a hotel room, they assaulted a 19-year-old among them who had a low intelligence quotient (IQ) and left him with serious injuries, including chemical burns and amnesia. One of the assailants, aged 16, also urinated in a bottle of iced lemon tea, which the victim later drank. For her actions earlier this year, the teenager was on Tuesday (July 26) ordered to undergo at least 12 months of reformative training - a regimented rehabilitation programme for offenders under 21 who commit relatively serious crimes. She cannot be named because the Children and Young Persons Act bans the publication of the identities of those who commit crimes while under 18. The offender is the first in the group to be sentenced. 
She pleaded guilty to one count each of voluntarily causing hurt, drug consumption and mischief. One of her accomplices, Putri Nuramira Aishah Rosli, 19, pleaded guilty and has not been sentenced yet. The other two - Muhammad Shahfakhry Mohamad Faizal, 21, and another 16-year-old girl - have been charged. WHAT HAPPENED The court heard that the victim, who studied at APSN Delta Senior School, had been acquainted with the female offender since 2018. He also knew Shahfakhry through her but did not know Putri. On Jan 15 this year, Shahfakhry, the offender and the other girl allegedly consumed methamphetamine, which is a Class A controlled drug, in a room at Arton Boutique Hotel along Tyrwhitt Road in Jalan Besar. The victim joined them after the offender told him where she was. He began staying over in the room two days later. Shahfakhry then allegedly began slapping, punching and kicking him, while the 16-year-old female offender also slapped and kicked him on his head a few times. The offender had told Shahfakhry that the victim wanted to have sex with her without her consent. The other 16-year-old filmed the violent acts. Two more days passed when the 16-year-old female offender asked the victim to leave the hotel room toilet where he was taking a shower. While in the toilet, she urinated in a bottle of iced lemon tea before handing it to the victim. When Shahfakhry asked what was in the bottle, the girl told him that the bottle contained her urine. Shahfakhry then asked the victim to consume the drink and the victim complied. The court heard that between Jan 17 and 25, the trio abused him with ""various implements and methods"". Some of these incidents were recorded and the 16-year-old offender was present for most of the incidents. No other details were given in court documents. On Jan 25, the group stopped hitting the 19-year-old after noticing that he was in a bad state. They bought some medication and bandages to treat his wounds. That same day, a social worker made a police report saying that the victim suddenly disappeared from his home two weeks ago. The worker added that he was discharged two months ago from the Singapore Boys' Home and stayed home every day. The social worker told the police: ""He did not pack anything, phone is turned off. Last known from phone app to be at Lavender. Said he was going to friend's house at Woodlands around 8pm to 9pm and coming back the next day."" The victim's younger sister also made a police report. She had seen a photo on social media of someone who was badly injured and appeared to be her brother. On Jan 26, the police found the group in the hotel room. The victim was assessed to be in a critical condition and was taken to Singapore General Hospital. He was hospitalised until Feb 4 and doctors had to give him nutritional support because of his limited mouth opening and acute stress reaction. He had sustained these injuries: Orbital floor fractures Chemical burns to his scalp, face and back Multiple superficial injuries such as slash wounds, lacerations, cigarette butt burns, and multiple cuts on his upper and lower limbs Amnesia with possible traumatic brain injury",Today (Singapore) - Online,26-07-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999952583939475}",en,0.9999952583939475

The Straits Times (Singapore)
July 30, 2022 Saturday","Eating disorders among young people are on the rise in Singapore, with hospitals seeing a higher number of patients amid the pandemic.
 In response to queries from The Straits Times, KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) said it had 50 to 70 new cases of patients aged 11 to 18 with eating disorders five years ago, but the number rose to more than 100 per year over the last two years.
 A spokesman for Singapore General Hospital said it saw nearly 230 patients with eating disorders last year, up from 170 the year before.
 Dr Courtney Davis, a senior staff physician at KKH, said better awareness about eating disorders is likely to have played a part in more cases coming to light, and the trend can be expected to continue.
 ""We are not able to pinpoint the underlying cause and research is ongoing. While the disruptions brought about by the pandemic have triggered a worsening of eating disorder symptoms in some patients, there were also patients whose condition improved as parents were able to spend more time at home to take care of them,"" she added.
 Eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, which is characterised by an abnormally low body weight and an intense fear of gaining weight, and bulimia nervosa which involves binge eating, followed by purging.
 Dr Davis said individuals with eating disorders have a distorted perception of their own weight and an extreme obsession with food and eating habits. They may become moody and irritable, secretive or ritualistic with food, and withdraw and isolate themselves from their families or social situations.
 To help parents care for children with eating disorders, KKH has collaborated with non-profit organisation Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL) on a new programme which equips participants with skills and knowledge to manage the recovery process.
 The content was developed by CAL with the help of physicians, psychologists and specialist nurses from KKH's eating disorder team.
 Through case studies, films and role plays, participants gain awareness about the different conditions. The sessions also include interactive discussions and insights from persons-in-recovery and caregivers.
 Parents are also encouraged to create a messaging group with other participants whom they can tap for support in the future.
 CAL conducted its first run of the programme last year, with 15 caregivers graduating from the three-month programme in June. In total, 70 caregivers have been trained in three runs so far.
 Counsellor Nandita Nalawala, who is programme and outreach manager at CAL, said children with eating disorders can present both physical symptoms like extreme fatigue, constipation or blood pressure issues as well as changes in behaviour, such as avoiding meal times with the family.
 She noted that treatments for those with eating disorders have to take a holistic approach, combining medication, psychotherapy and the support of caregivers and family members.
 The initiative by CAL gives parents a safe space to validate some of their challenges and share their experiences with others, she added.
 ""Over time, the participants build a fraternity and recognise that they are not isolated.

August 1, 2022 Monday","SINGAPORE - While making a right turn from Cross Street to Robinson Road in the Central Business District, Muhammad Said Shahidir Dres failed to notice a 78-year-old pedestrian at a crossing and crashed into her. Following the accident on April 3, 2020, the victim succumbed to her injuries in Singapore General Hospital the next morning. On Monday (Aug 1), Said, 35, was sentenced to four months' jail and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of licences for eight years upon his release. 
The Singaporean pleaded guilty to an offence under the Road Traffic Act of driving without due care and attention. The court heard that the accident happened just before the circuit breaker period came into force, which limited movements and activities due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Said was driving his Toyota Hiace manual van, which had an unladen weight of 1,760kg, towards One Raffles Quay to deliver some items. As he approached the signalised cross junction of Cross Street and Robinson Road, he drove on the first lane with the intention of turning onto Robinson Road towards Collyer Quay. The victim then began crossing the signalised pedestrian crossing from Hong Leong Building to CapitaGreen. Said collided with her when she had completed crossing three of the four lanes. She fell to the ground and began bleeding. She was taken to hospital where she died from a severe traumatic head injury the following morning. Deputy Public Prosecutor Ben Mathias Tan told the court that Said was the leading vehicle when he executed the right turn, and there were no vehicles beside his van as well.

The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 2, 2022 Tuesday","Covers have been installed over a drain at Block 22 Havelock Road, a day after a man in his late 50s fell in and got stuck for 30 minutes before he was rescued.
 A video of the incident on Sunday afternoon, posted by Facebook group SG Road Vigilante, shows five paramedics carefully lifting the man out of the drain and preparing to transfer him to a nearby stretcher.
 A small group of onlookers from the neighbouring Beo Crescent Market can be seen watching the rescue in the video.
 The Straits Times understands the man was assessed by the paramedics to have sustained back injuries.
 The Singapore Civil Defence Force said it received a call for assistance at about 4.50pm on Sunday, and the man was conscious when he was taken to the Singapore General Hospital.
 When ST visited the site yesterday afternoon, workers from the Jalan Besar Town Council could be seen clearing the drain of fallen tree branches and leaves.
 Drain covers had been installed, with residents saying the drain was not covered previously.
 Recalling the incident, Ms Nu Nu Hlaing, 50, who lives in the area, said she was returning from grocery shopping at the nearby FairPrice outlet when she saw the man dashing through the bushes to cross the road before the traffic lights turned red.
 He then fell into the drain, which runs between Block 22 and Havelock Road.
 Ms Nu Nu Hlaing, a shop assistant, said: ""I was behind him when he fell suddenly. People were shouting for help. I was glad that someone called for an ambulance, which arrived about 10 minutes later.""
 Checks by ST show that the drain, which is about 35cm wide and 70cm deep, can be difficult to climb out of once a person falls in.

250,"Robots to the rescue as various sectors battle manpower crunch; Automation helps staff keep up with service demands, allows better allocation of resources
The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 10, 2022 Wednesday","Cargo-carrying wheeled robots are important members of the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) as the hospital battles an ongoing manpower crunch that has only become more acute in recent times.
 Whirring around SingHealth Tower - which opened in January as part of a $4 billion, 20-year revamp of the SGH campus - the 13 robots now deliver meals, linen and medical supplies to 16 wards in the building.
 The robots, which look like refrigerators on wheels, have relieved SGH of the need to hire five support staff for such deliveries, its director of service support Joseph Chua told The Straits Times.
 SGH said this allows it to focus on filling in-demand roles such as nursing and medical support.
 ""By automating supplies transportation, SGH can (also) optimise productivity and schedule deliveries more effectively,"" said Mr Chua.
 Sensors on the robots help them navigate around the campus autonomously. The sensors map out the route and identify obstacles to avoid collision.
 There are plans for the robots to deliver medical supplies to the upcoming Elective Care Centre building on the SGH campus.
 Healthcare, hospitality and aviation are among the sectors that have been hardest hit by an ongoing labour crunch amplified by the Covid-19 pandemic.
 Job vacancies in health and social services rose to 7,700 in March from 6,500 in December, according to the Ministry of Manpower's June labour report.
 Job vacancies in accommodation and food services also rose to 9,900 in March this year from 8,900 last December.
 When Covid-19 restrictions started to ease in April this year, leading to spikes in service demands, the tight manpower situation in consumer-facing sectors worsened.
 The 1,252-room Swissotel The Stamford relies on 10 self-service kiosks to automate check-ins as the hospitality sector faces a manpower crunch with the return of travellers.
 Check-in can also be initiated via a Web link on guests' devices before arrival at the hotel to save time.
 ""The automated check-in and check-out counters help to alleviate the challenges of the tight labour market in Singapore,"" said Mr Marcus Hanna, managing director of Swissotel The Stamford and Fairmont Singapore.
 He added that besides simplifying work processes and eliminating paperwork, this has also freed up front office staff for more personalised interactions, such as welcoming guests when they arrive at the driveway and assisting with simple concierge inquiries.
 The kiosks, which blend seamlessly into the living room-like hotel lobby, can also use in-built biometric facial scanners to verify guest identities by matching the data against the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority's database. This increases the level of security. The machines also require guests to encode their own room keys before they can be used.
 The kiosks were fully rolled out in June 2020 at the height of the pandemic to minimise physical contact and interaction.
 Electronic kiosks are also a new feature at all 10 information counters in Changi Airport's Terminal 1 and Terminal 3, allowing travellers to contact the airport's service staff stationed in an office at another part of the airport via video call. Up to three employees can be present to take any calls.
 The kiosks, which were introduced during the pandemic by Changi Airport Group (CAG), allow the counters to be manned even when service personnel are deployed to other areas.
 CAG is also trialling three autonomous baggage tractors to transport passenger baggage between airplanes and Changi Airport's Terminal 3.
 Mr Yeo Kia Thye, CAG's managing director for airport operations planning and airside, said automating baggage transportation will allow airside workers to focus on more complex last-mile operations such as aircraft handling.

251,"When words hurt; Speak with care to those who have eating disorders - they are often plagued with critical thoughts about themselves
The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 10, 2022 Wednesday","Ms Bernice Lee started having eating disorders at 14.
 Now 21 and a freelancer in the music industry, she would keep her dietary intake to as low as 300 calories a day or vomit out what she had eaten.
 Besides fasting and self-induced vomiting, her distorted body image and obsessive desire to lose weight caused her to have dysfunctional thoughts.
 It was only around last year when she felt like she got to a better place. Though healing is not a linear process, she finds ways to remind herself to treat herself kindly, such as having a note on her bulletin board that reads: ""I choose to celebrate my body and see it with love.""
 For the seven years that she struggled with eating disorders, she found herself easily affected by comments made by the people around her.
 Even when told she had lost weight, she would still worry about maintaining the weight loss or get spurred on to lose more. ""I get really affected both when my relatives tell me I've lost weight and when my mother tells me I've gained weight,"" she says.
 Ms Lee's experience underlines how it is important to be sensitive when talking to people about their appearance or weight, especially for people whom you suspect of having an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia.
 Ms Ng Jing Xuan, a senior psychologist at Singapore General Hospital, says a common dysfunctional thought associated with eating disorders is: ""Others will not accept me if I gain weight.""
 Parents, in particular, should be mindful of how they talk about physical appearance in front of their children, she tells The Straits Times.
 ""They should avoid praising their children in appearance-based ways, with 'compliments' such as 'You look much better now that you have slimmer thighs.'""
 Ms Henny Tan, a senior clinical psychologist at Promises Healthcare, says a patient may misinterpret comments like ""You look well"" or ""You look healthy"" to mean ""You look fat"". She explains that patients are often plagued with critical thoughts about themselves, viewing the world through an eating disorder lens or filter.
 Her advice is to avoid ""body talk"", such as mentions of one's own size or food. Remarks like ""My food is so fatty"" may also encourage insecurities, she adds.
 Ms Ng says that comments such as ""Just eat, it's not that hard"" and ""You're just not trying hard enough to recover"" should be avoided.
 Both psychologists note that it is important for the loved ones of those with an eating disorder to be patient with them, as there are often shameful sentiments attached to such conditions.
 With sufferers often isolating themselves out of shame, it is good to engage them and take them out for social activities that they would enjoy, notes Ms Tan.
 Parents of sufferers, Ms Tan stresses, should insist on getting their children to seek professional help, and not give in to their hostility or defensiveness.
 On the other hand, some sufferers may be troubled by parents who do not take the disorder seriously.
 Says Ms Lee, who mustered the courage to tell her family about her condition in 2018: ""I was crying on the floor, but my dad said I was fine because nobody in our family had it. While they did not have bad intentions, they were in denial because it was a culture shock to them.""
 In such cases, Ms Tan advises that patients seek help directly from doctors, who can refer them to specialists who can explain that eating disorders are life-threatening.
 Besides seeking professional help to manage dysfunctional thoughts, Ms Tan says sufferers should detach themselves from these ways of thinking.
 Adds Ms Ng: ""It is important for them to understand that we cannot get rid of thoughts or emotions. The more we try to do so, the longer they will stay. Learn to make space for such difficult thoughts and emotions, letting them come and go naturally.

252,"Meal delivery robots, autonomous baggage tractors lend a hand
The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 10, 2022 Wednesday","Healthcare, hospitality and aviation are among the sectors hit the hardest by an ongoing labour shortage that has been escalated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Such labour woes have continued or deepened as restrictions started to ease from April this year and visitors returned to Singapore.
Robots and automation have come to the rescue. Here are some ways technology has relieved the manpower crunch in the three sectors.
  1 SELF-SERVICE CHECK-IN/ CHECK-OUT KIOSKS AT SWISSOTEL THE STAMFORD The lobby of Swissotel The Stamford houses 10 self-service counters where guests can check in and even encode their own room key card.
 The kiosks were fully rolled out in June 2020 at the height of the pandemic to minimise physical contact and interaction. The system is even more valuable now as the hotel faces a manpower crunch with the return of travellers.
 On arrival, guests scan their reservation details to authenticate the booking confirmation, and scan their passports.
 As a security measure, the in-built biometric facial scanner verifies each guest's identity against the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority's database before the system completes the process.
 Guests then scan an empty key card to encode it, and receive a printout with their room number.
 Since June 2020, guests have also been able to register and check in prior to arrival via a Web link on any device. Check-in now takes a minute, down from five minutes previously.
 Checking out is also done in a matter of seconds via the Web or the kiosks, and without the hassle of having to download any applications. Credit card details, collected as part of pre-arrival check-in, allow for quick checkout. Alternatively, payment can be done at the kiosk using credit cards.
 A staff member is always on hand to assist guests for check-in and checkout.
 As check-in and checkout processes are all digitalised, no registration card or credit card charge slip is needed.
 Hotel staff also do not need to do menial filing or labour-intensive book balancing at the end of their shifts, thus freeing them up for more meaningful engagement with guests while on duty.
  2 FOOD DELIVERY ROBOTS AT S'PORE GENERAL HOSPITAL Thirteen robots transport meals, linen and medical supplies from the Singapore General Hospital's (SGH) Campus Logistics Hub to 16 patient wards at SGH's SingHealth Tower, which opened in January.
 Sensors on the robots help them navigate around the campus autonomously. The sensors map out the route and identify obstacles to prevent collision.
 Delivery robots, which travel only to designated locations in SingHealth Tower, pick up and unload trolleys of food or linen prepared by hospital staff. To access various levels in the building, the robots use selected cargo lifts that have systems to detect and communicate with them.
 The new building has the infrastructure - such as sensor-based systems in selected lifts - to support the robots' operations. SGH's remaining 39 patient wards are in older buildings, which do not have such systems to accommodate them.
 There are plans for the robots to deliver medical supplies to the upcoming Elective Care Centre building on the campus.
  3 AUTONOMOUS BAGGAGE TRACTORS AT CHANGI AIRPORT Currently on trial at Changi Airport's Terminal 3, three autonomous baggage tractors transport passenger baggage between airplanes and the terminal's baggage handling area.
 Each robot travels on pre-mapped routes and uses sensors to detect obstacles, vehicles and pedestrians in its way.
 The first autonomous tractor was trialled in August last year, before being joined by two other robots in January this year.
 They are part of Changi Airport Group's plans to automate operations to allow human workers to focus on more complex last-mile tasks such as aircraft handling.
  4 VIRTUAL ASSISTANTS AT CHANGI AIRPORT The service, introduced by Changi Airport Group during the pandemic, allows the airport's service staff to help travellers remotely through kiosks at 10 information counters in Terminals 1 and 3.
 Travellers in need of help can use the video-call function on the kiosks to contact the airport's service personnel, who are stationed in an office at another part of the airport. They can answer calls from multiple kiosks without needing to be physically present.

253,"50 residents evacuated after fire breaks out at Toa Payoh flat; one taken to hospital for smoke inhalation
Channel NewsAsia
August 12, 2022 Friday 9:22 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: About 50 residents were evacuated from a Housing Board block in Toa Payoh on Friday (Aug 12) evening following a blaze in one of the units. One person was also taken to the hospital for smoke inhalation.
In an update on Facebook at about 11.15pm, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted to a fire at Block 222 Lorong 8 Toa Payoh at about 8.20pm.
Upon arrival, SCDF said the fire was raging and thick black smoke was emitting from a unit on the third storey.
""At the height of the firefighting operation, two water jets were deployed to fight the fire,"" it said, adding that the entire unit was affected by heat and smoke damage.
Photos taken by SCDF showed the charred interior of the unit, its walls and floors darkened with soot. ONE PERSON TAKEN TO HOSPITAL
One person was taken to Singapore General Hospital for smoke inhalation, said SCDF.
Another person was assessed by an SCDF paramedic for smoke inhalation and later refused to be taken to the hospital.
About 50 residents were evacuated by SCDF and the police as a precautionary measure.
""We understand some occupants of the affected block had self-evacuated proactively,"" said SCDF, adding that the cause of the fire is under investigation. ""THE SMOKE WAS REALLY DISTINCT""
Footage of the incident showed dozens of people standing outside the block, some of them recording with their mobile phones. Shattering glass could be heard as the blaze raged from the unit's window.
A CNA reader, who declined to be named, said the fire started at about 8.10pm.
""I was in my room. I (smelled) smoke before being (alerted) that there was a fire happening,"" she said.
""I thought it was just for the (Hungry Ghost Festival) prayers, but I (noticed) the smoke was really distinct and coming into my room through the window."" The reader quickly left her flat and went downstairs.
""I saw others coming out (of) their houses and the neighbour downstairs said it was the third floor. So I went back to inform my neighbour,"" she said.
""I just felt like something isn't right and quickly evacuated from my room."" When asked if she noticed anything prior to the fire, the resident said that she just found the odour of the smoke to be ""a little unusual"", similar to the smell of an electrical fire.
The reader reported that there was ""a small explosion"" as the fire escalated at around 8.25pm. By then, SCDF firefighters were already on the scene alongside police officers who cordoned off the area.
Most of the block's residents had left their flats by this time, she added.
In a comment on SCDF's first post, Facebook user Audrey Anne Felix said that her mother and godchild had left their flat on the 19th floor of the block.
They had earlier attempted to prevent smoke from entering the unit by placing wet towels under their doorway, she said, thanking SCDF for their ""quick action in putting out the fire"".
In response to queries from CNA, the police said on Sunday that they were alerted to the incident at about 8.20pm on Friday.
""A 72-year-old woman was conscious when conveyed to the hospital. The fire was subsequently put out by SCDF personnel. No further police assistance was required."" INITIAL: kg(zl)",Channel NewsAsia,16-08-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999972474113444}",en,0.9999972474113444
254,"Jailed for hitting auxiliary cop with car, verbally abusing him
The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 16, 2022 Tuesday","When he was caught by an auxiliary police officer for leaving Singapore General Hospital (SGH) via an unauthorised exit, Yeo Yong Hao verbally abused the officer and later hit him with his car twice.
 The officer suffered bruises on his left leg and was given three days' sick leave as a result.
 Yesterday, Yeo, 31, was sentenced to nine weeks' jail and banned from driving for a year and two months after his release from prison.
 He had pleaded guilty to one count each of committing a rash act that endangers the personal safety of others and using abusive words towards a public servant.
 The court heard that Yeo had gone to SGH in April last year to pick up his girlfriend's mother.
 He wanted to leave the hospital via a glass door that was not accessible to the public and could be opened only by staff.
 When auxiliary police officer Syahmi Rusydi Sobirin, 25, opened the door with his staff pass, Yeo followed him. Mr Syahmi told him to use another exit but was ignored. Yeo then made derogatory comments about the officer and said he was just a Certis Cisco officer and not a police officer.
 Mr Syahmi followed Yeo to the carpark and stood in front of his car to stop him from leaving, but Yeo drove forward and hit the officer's leg. This happened again after Yeo confronted the officer and sounded his car horn continually.
 Deputy Public Prosecutor Emily Zhao said Yeo had used abusive and racially charged language at the officer, and injured him twice.
 ""The degree of rashness in this case is very high and borders on being intentional. The accused clearly saw the officer standing in front of the car and knew the officer was telling him to stop.""
 For committing a rash act, Yeo could have been jailed up to six months and fined up to $2,500.

255,"Automated wave of the future is here
The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 16, 2022 Tuesday","Healthcare, hospitality and aviation, among the sectors hardest hit by an ongoing labour crunch amplified by the coronavirus pandemic, are coping with demand in novel ways. Wheeled robots carry cargo at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), self-service kiosks at Swissotel The Stamford automate check-ins, and electronic kiosks exist at information counters in Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3. Automation allows SGH, for example, to focus on filling in-demand roles such as nursing and medical support. The hospital can also optimise productivity and schedule deliveries more effectively by automating the transport of supplies. For Swissotel The Stamford, the automated check-in and check-out counters simplify work processes, eliminate paperwork, free up front-office staff for more personalised interactions, and use in-built biometric facial scanners to verify guest identities, thus increasing the level of security. Apart from the use of the kiosks, Changi's automation of baggage transport frees airside workers to focus on more complex last-mile operations such as aircraft handling. At the end of the day, patients, guests and travellers benefit from initiatives that cater to their needs amid a labour shortage.
 This is the automated wave of the future on which Singapore at large must ride. According to the International Federation of Robotics, Singapore ranked first in the world for robot density - or robots installed per 10,000 employees - in the manufacturing industry in 2019. Robotics and automation are becoming common in industries from automotive to aerospace to consumer goods, and as the understanding of robotics increases, so, too, does the ability to implement automated systems in more sectors. The Economic Development Board notes the broader perspective within which automation should be seen. The fourth industrial revolution is upon the world. The first three industrial revolutions of mechanisation, mass production and computerisation define the world today. The fourth will usher in a new age of innovation and transformation characterised by the advent of cyberphysical systems that reflect the convergence of the digital and physical worlds.
 Robots augment the work of human workers by lifting the most common and predictable loads off their shoulders, thus allowing them to concentrate on tasks that only humans can do best - such as interacting with other humans, particularly those who are not as digitally savvy as the rest. This coexistence of man and machine signifies neither utopia nor dystopia. Robots cannot replace humans to the point that man can live entirely off the work of machines. Nor can automation make human labour redundant. Instead, automation situates Singapore favourably in the trajectory of the fourth industrial revolution.",The Straits Times (Singapore),15-08-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999945408889077}",en,0.9999945408889077
256,"Electronic screening at SGH gives docs more time to help patients
The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 17, 2022 Wednesday","An electronic system that screens and categorises patients before surgery has allowed anaesthesiologists at the Singapore General Hospital to devote more time to high-risk patients.
 It categorises patients into high-and low-risk groups based on their existing co-morbidities, predicting their suitability for surgery and anaesthesia. High-risk patients save more than four minutes of consultation time as information from the assessment is available to the doctors beforehand, while low-risk patients need only do a remote screening with a nurse over the phone.
 This helped cut the number of consultations done by anaesthesiologists by almost 2,000 between August last year and June - equivalent to about 1,410 hours, or more than 58 days, said Manpower Minister Tan See Leng yesterday.
 ""Anaesthesiologists can now devote more time to pre-surgery counselling to ensure health optimisation of high-risk patients, and patients also save time at the pre-surgery assessment,"" he said.
 Associate Professor Hairil Abdullah, a senior consultant with the anaesthesiology department at SGH, said: ""It's significant because even though it's four to five minutes per patient, my clinic sees about 100 to 110 patients a day.""
 The system was one of a number of innovations highlighted by Dr Tan during the Singapore Healthcare Management Congress held at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre. Another was a system that automates the documentation of ward procedures, such as the dressing of complex wounds, performed by nurses and allied health professionals. The initiative allows for billing to be done directly and accurately, saving more than 1,700 hours per month.
 SingHealth's group chief nurse, Adjunct Associate Professor Tracy Carol Ayre, said the system freed up nurses from performing rote tasks, allowing them to devote more time to direct patient care.
 It has been rolled out to all SingHealth institutions since last December, and is expected to include procedures performed by doctors by the end of next year.
 Technology and process innovation can optimise the ""precious manpower"" in the healthcare sector, said Dr Tan.
 According to the Manpower Ministry's labour report in June, job vacancies in health and social services rose to 7,700 in March, up from 6,500 in December last year.
 And earlier this month, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam said in Parliament that the attrition rate among public sector nurses increased last year, with attrition among foreign nurses more than doubling to 14.8 per cent.",The Straits Times (Singapore),16-08-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999978950610549}",en,0.9999978950610549

The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 20, 2022 Saturday","Senior citizens in the Beo Crescent area will have greater access to services such as counselling, job placement and befriending under two agreements signed yesterday.
 Under one of the agreements - signed between Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities (THKMC) and the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) - residents of Beo Crescent, where a THK Active Ageing Centre is located, can access services such as tele-consultations and medication delivery.
 The collaboration will give the organisation a ""network of resources"" to help seniors in Bukit Merah and Tiong Bahru, said SGH population health and integrated care office director Low Lian Leng.
 Meanwhile, a separate agreement was signed between THKMC, the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), Sage Counselling Centre and Tsao Foundation.
 AIC will support the Beo Crescent centre via its Communities of Care initiative, which will give the centre resources needed to build partnerships with other organisations.
 The agency will also refer seniors to the active ageing centre for services such as befriending and case management.
 THKMC's collaboration with the Sage Counselling Centre will provide counselling to the elderly as well as their family members and caregivers, while Tsao Foundation will help seniors in areas such as job placements.
 Witnessing the ceremony was Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who also toured the active ageing centre.
 The Beo Crescent centre - appointed by the Ministry of Health and AIC as an active ageing centre last year - was chosen for yesterday's initiatives due to the large number of seniors living in the vicinity.
 THKMC chief operating officer Jason Lee said the collaborations were aimed at improving the experience of senior citizens in its centres.
 ""The seniors can look forward to ageing healthily and independently,"" he said.
 Speaking to reporters yesterday, THKMC divisional director for elderly services Andy Lee said the new initiatives would benefit up to 300 people in the area, adding that he hoped for similar initiatives to be extended to its other centres.

258,"New calculator to estimate cancer treatment expenses; Tool may help in doc-patient discussions on options as revised insurance model looms
The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 20, 2022 Saturday","A new chemotherapy and cancer treatment cost calculator was launched yesterday to help patients estimate their expenses, in the light of upcoming changes to the Ministry of Health's (MOH) cancer insurance model.
 From next month, only clinically proven and cost-effective drug treatments on a new Cancer Drug List will be eligible for claims under MediSave and MediShield Life, as part of efforts to rein in the soaring costs of cancer treatment.
 ""This means that each drug now has specific individual claim limits and its eligibility for subsidies will depend on the reasons for prescribing it,"" said Dr Jen Wei Ying, an associate consultant at the Department of Haematology-Oncology at the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore (NCIS).
 ""Subsidies will also be determined by the patient's per capita household income, eligibility for other government schemes and residency status,"" she said.
 Additionally, as most cancer drugs are prescribed in combination, only a single claim can be made - and this would be the drug with the highest claim limit.
 This makes estimates of out-of-pocket expenses and financial counselling more complex for patients who are prescribed combinations of drugs with varying claim limits, she noted.
 Costs that are incurred during cancer treatment, such as the cost of anti-nausea drugs, would from next month have a separate reimbursement limit, she added.
 Thus, a team from NCIS and local artificial intelligence health technology start-up Bot MD came up with a cost calculator - known as ChemoCalc - to estimate a patient's treatment cost and provide financial counselling.
 Bot MD chief executive and co-founder Dorothea Koh said that various schemes - including the Cancer Drug List, drug subsidy schemes like the Medication Assistance Fund and the Standard Drug List, as well as the Pioneer and Merdeka Generation schemes - have been integrated into the calculator.
 All staff at NCIS will have access to the calculator via an app or Web browsers.
 Doctors can use the calculator to get an idea of costs for patients and decide on treatment options and the next course of action, such as referring patients to medical social workers, said Dr Jen.
 The calculator will be updated in tandem with national revisions and price revisions to ensure that the estimated costs are aligned with the actual amounts patients are expected to pay, said Ms Koh.
 ChemoCalc can also be adapted for use in other healthcare institutions.
 MOH had said earlier that the drugs on the Cancer Drug List and their uses will be reviewed and, if necessary, updated every four months. Oncologists can also ask for drugs to be added.
 With the changes, it has been estimated that one in 10 patients treated in the public sector will not have his current treatment covered by drugs on the approved list, with the number expected to be higher for the private sector.
 ""Currently, it is easy to estimate reimbursements for each patient - a maximum of $3,000 is deducted from his MediShield Life, and another $1,200 from MediSave,"" said Dr Jen.
 But the latest changes could mean that calculations are less straightforward, and the ChemoCalc would help, she added.
 Brain Tumour Society Singapore president Melissa Lim, who was not involved in the calculator project, said that manually calculating the cost of cancer treatment for patients could take a long time, which would add to one's anxiety, especially if one is newly diagnosed with cancer.
 ""Being able to understand the upfront costs immediately could open doors for more realistic treatment options, and allows patients to explore more cost-effective treatment plans without delay,"" she said.
 Dr Cheong May Anne, an associate consultant at the Singapore General Hospital's Department of Haematology, who was also not involved in the project, said that with changes to the financing model for cancer treatment, the calculator would greatly help facilitate doctors' treatment discussions with patients.",The Straits Times (Singapore),19-08-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999971697622464}",en,0.9999971697622464
259,"Commentary: COVID-19 has created an 'immunity debt' towards common infections in our children
Channel NewsAsia
August 20, 2022 Saturday 6:01 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: COVID-19 has been a big disruption to the world. Pandemic response measures not only helped keep the coronavirus at bay, but also had the effect of curbing the spread of other respiratory illnesses like the common cold and influenza.
But as restrictions are relaxed or lifted with the widespread use of vaccines and antivirals, several viruses and bacteria are now making a comeback.
It makes sense that measures targeted at preventing COVID-19 reduced the spread of infections transmitted via respiratory droplets. People stopped travelling, worked from home, wore masks and stayed in when unwell.
Combined data from KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), Singapore General Hospital and National University Hospital showed that most non-COVID-19 respiratory viruses nearly disappeared by April and May 2020, when Singapore went into a ""circuit breaker"" period. With the reopening in phases in late 2020, some respiratory viruses gradually returned, though not at pre-pandemic levels, since mask-wearing in public continued.
Amid concerns about the Delta and Omicron variant waves in the second half of 2021 and early months of 2022, healthcare professionals saw non-COVID respiratory illness levels drop again after response measures were tightened and subsequently come up when eased. Similar effects were seen overseas. Also, the usual flu seasons were absent.
RETURN OF CHILDHOOD RESPIRATORY VIRUSES NOT SURPRISING
The return of respiratory viruses is not surprising to healthcare experts.
The first ones to return, in late 2020, were the rhinoviruses and enteroviruses which usually cause mild common colds. Then, early 2021 saw a reappearance of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and some parainfluenza viruses, both of which may cause more serious illness in young children, such as bronchiolitis or croup, which has a distinctive barking cough.
What is surprising is the unusual pattern of activity of viruses that usually have a predictable seasonality.
In Australia, the United States and Europe, waves of RSV infections were recorded outside the traditional winter months. Several countries, at some point, reported that RSV waves were stretching the capacity of children's hospitals that were already under pressure from COVID-19. Another observation was that RSV infections occurred in older children, whereas before the pandemic, children less than one-year-old were mostly affected. In some locations, the numbers of RSV infections even surpassed those of COVID-19 paediatric infections at times.
What might explain these changes? Due to all the pandemic response measures, young children, including those born during the pandemic, have had much less exposure to common respiratory viruses than same-age children in pre-pandemic years.
This created an ""immunity debt"" towards previously common infections, meaning that the lack of exposure to viruses and bacteria during the pandemic left children more susceptible to various infections. INFLUENZA AND OTHER VIRAL INFECTIONS MIGHT LIE AHEAD
Can we expect to see other respiratory illnesses make a comeback? Probably.
Influenza viruses (there are A and B strains) nearly disappeared during the pandemic, and only a small number of influenza infections were observed again in the first half of 2022, according to data from KKH. These numbers are expected to rise in the second half of 2022; Australia is currently experiencing a substantial rise in influenza infections, and international travel is likely to bring this to Singapore soon. Before the pandemic, KKH regularly diagnosed bacterial respiratory infections, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae (which causes pneumonia predominantly in children) and Bordetella pertussis (the agent of classical whooping cough). These infections also disappeared during the 2020 circuit breaker and have not reappeared up until mid-2022.
Parents may also be concerned about children getting multiple infections. In June, Singapore recorded the first paediatric COVID-19 death in a one-and-a-half-year-old boy who had COVID-19, RSV and enterovirus infections.
With Singapore recording a seven-day moving average of 3,750 COVID-19 cases (as of Aug 18) and yet another Omicron subvariant, various respiratory viruses are also returning with relaxation of some of the earlier pandemic measures.
LIVING WITH RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
What does this all mean for us in Singapore? Respiratory viruses have been with us for a very long time and are part of what helps train our immune systems and those of our children.
It is their absence, rather than presence, that is an unusual state. Their return after the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic should be seen as part of the return to normality. But we should still take precautionary measures and stay vigilant, due to the possibility of severe illnesses in some children and vulnerable adults.
This means we should take good care of ourselves and our children and seek medical care if infections look to become more serious. Signs to look out for in children are worsening or persistent fever, lethargy or drowsiness, persistent cough, breathlessness, chest pain, poor oral intake, poor urine output, or seizures.
It is also recommended that we keep our influenza vaccinations up to date. Anyone above six months of age can obtain their influenza vaccination at their local general practitioner (GP) clinic or polyclinic.
COVID-19 may have changed the way we think of and live with viruses, and we should keep up some of the habits we have picked up along the way.

260,"When death comes knocking: How healthcare workers support parents who lost their child
Today (Singapore) - Online
August 20, 2022 Saturday","SINGAPORE - For nurse clinician Audrey Seet, her job as a neonatal bereavement nurse does not just involve taking care of premature babies, but also sitting with grieving parents going through one of life's biggest tragedies: That of losing a child. ""Some mothers, when carrying their demised baby, will tell the baby: 'Baby we haven't even gone home yet. You've never even stepped out of this unit,"" said Ms Seet. ""All these words always sink deep... And it's the cries of the mothers that pierce right into my heart."" The 36-year-old nurse, who has been working at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for 15 years, first formed a small team of bereavement nurses in 2017 after an attachment at a hospital in the United Kingdom. 
There, she saw how families would have a bereavement nurse to lean on right from the child's prognosis and through the death process, which was something that resonated with her. ""Support is extremely important for us, especially in Asian cultures where we tend to be more conservative when expressing ourselves emotionally. So I thought this was extremely meaningful,"" she said. Amid a heightened awareness of how hard nurses have had it lately, TODAY spoke to three healthcare workers who handle one of the hardest jobs in medical care - providing support to grieving parents who have lost their child - to find out about the challenges of taking on such a heavy task. CREATING MEMORIES BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD These healthcare workers said that their work typically involves counselling parents after the death of their child and following up with phone calls around a month after to check on them. Depending on the child's prognosis, the support may start even when the child is still alive, to help parents with memory making before the child dies. Broaching the topic of a child's potential death is never easy, said Ms Seet, and the initial counselling session is always the most challenging because of how sensitive it is. ""But we will explain to them that the intention (of speaking about it early) is to create more opportunities for them to bond with their baby such as skin to skin contact or being able to hold them,"" she said. The nurses will also ask parents what they would ""love to keep as a memory of their child"". Dr Teresa Tan, who oversees the paediatric palliative care service at the National University Hospital (NUH), said that parents may reject talking about it because it sounds like their child is ""going to die"". But she explained that making such mental preparations also helps parents have ""a sense of control in an already helpless situation"", especially when they see ""their child's condition going downhill and there's nothing they can do to stop the process"". ""Things like deciding what's important for them to remember their child - whether they want this physical keepsake or if holding their child is good enough - to be able to have these choices helps in the preparatory process and invariably the bereavement process,"" said Dr Tan. To help parents with memory making, SGH, NUH and KK Women's and Children's Hospital told TODAY that they provide parents with memory boxes consisting of mementos such as photographs, handprints and footprints. They also partner with Angel Hearts, which supplies gowns for babies to wear after their deaths. Over 100 volunteers would hand sew these tiny gowns made from donated wedding dresses. Ms Tan Fang Ling, the founder of Angel Hearts, said she believes that providing these gowns help to support and bring closure for parents. ""When it happens, there's no time to buy a clothing to dress them and whatever you have is probably too big,"" the 44-year-old said. But still, it is never easy for parents and some of them may feel like they are ""betraying"" their child by moving on and being happy, said Ms Seet. ""So I will tell them to give themselves a period of time to grieve and then take small steps to walk out of it and move on - not forgetting your baby but to keep him or her in a special place in your heart."" 'LIKE A WARM BLANKET' One beneficiary of such bereavement support services is 41-year-old Penny Ng, who was the first patient Ms Seet from SGH counselled after setting up the team in 2017. Diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013, Ms Ng suffered a relapse in 2017 and was told that she had stage four cancer, as it had spread to her lungs. In that same year, she found out that she was pregnant and despite her doctors advising against it, she and her husband decided to keep the baby. Unfortunately, her condition worsened towards her seventh month of pregnancy and the couple had no choice but to return to the hospital, where the doctors advised her to deliver the child immediately. But upon giving birth, Ms Ng's child died within a few minutes as the baby could not survive outside her womb. ""I remember holding the baby in my arms and thinking to myself, I hope no parent has to go through what I'm going through,"" said Ms Ng. And while she was in the delivery room with tears streaming down her face, Ms Seet simply sat next to her without saying a word and held her hand. ""I will never forget how that felt, she felt like a very warm and fuzzy blanket,"" Ms Ng said with a laugh, adding that the warmth Ms Seet brought made her ""feel comforted and assured"". Even though years have passed since then, Ms Ng and Ms Seet's relationship has extended beyond the walls of the hospital. The two still keep in touch and would often contact each other to catch up. COMPASSION FATIGUE Although these healthcare workers said that it is a ""privilege"" to journey with parents through such tough times, they admitted that the work does inadvertently take a toll on them. Ms Mak Wei Lan, a senior medical social worker at KKH in her 30s, shared about ""compassion fatigue"", which refers to the emotional and physical stress that may come about from helping people who are experiencing trauma or high stress. She recalled a time when she felt exhausted and said that what helped her overcome these feelings was to first ""acknowledge them"" and speak to her supervisor about it. Similarly, Ms Seet said that she exercises regularly to prevent such heavy feelings from overwhelming her. Having insight into one's emotions and setting boundaries are also important, said Dr Tan. But ultimately, for these healthcare professionals, it is the knowledge that their work is helping someone and words of gratitude that help keep them going. And many times, they in turn receive strength from those grieving, too. ""Despite the crisis they are facing in those critical moments, you see a lot of parents who are able to get by through their resilience. They have that grace to carry on and this is something that I always take with me,"" said Ms Mak.",Today (Singapore) - Online,20-08-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999966815732506}",en,0.9999966815732506
261,"Kidney swop transplant gives woman new lease of life; Process allows medically incompatible couple to 'exchange' kidneys with another such pair
The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 22, 2022 Monday","Ms Serene Mai, a 37-year-old who suffered from kidney failure, has received a new lease of life through an arrangement called a kidney swop.
 Her husband, 39-year-old administrator Kevin Wee, wanted to donate his kidney to her, but their blood groups are incompatible for a transplant - his is B+ and hers is A.
 While it is possible for her to undergo a transplant using his kidney, the procedure would be more risky and more costly compared with a transplant from someone of a compatible blood group.
 So Mr Wee donated his kidney to an anonymous recipient, and that person's loved one, who is medically compatible with Ms Mai, gave his or her kidney to her late last year.
 The procedure is known as a paired kidney exchange transplant, where a pair of living donor and recipient who are medically incompatible, such as having incompatible blood groups or tissue types, ""exchange"" their kidney with another such pair. This arrangement lets recipients receive a kidney from a donor they are medically compatible with.
 While the Wees do not know the identity of the pair involved in their kidney swop, Ms Mai said: ""They gave not just one person but two persons a new lease of life.""
 Kidney swops are rare in Singapore. Including Ms Mai and her husband, there have been only five paired kidney exchange transplants benefiting 10 patients here since the first case in 2015, Professor Tan Chee Kiat, director of the National Organ Transplant Unit at the Health Ministry, told The Straits Times.
 These transplants are allowed here since 2009, he said, adding that the identities of both pairs of donors and recipients are kept anonymous to protect their privacy and medical confidentiality.
 The National Organ Transplant Unit coordinates the paired kidney exchange transplants here, and it oversees the National Kidney Paired Exchange Registry.
 As at June this year, there are five pairs on the registry waiting to be matched and the waiting time for a paired exchange transplant is about four to five months. In comparison, the average wait for a kidney from a dead donor is more than eight years, said Prof Tan.
 In June, ST reported that the number of kidney transplants has fallen over the past two years and the waiting time for a donor kidney has grown longer.
    WORTHWHILE EXCHANGE  Before her transplant, Serene was so tired and angsty. I feel that giving my kidney is worth it. I got my wife back.
    MR KEVIN WEE  For example, there were 33 kidney transplants involving dead donors in 2019; the number fell to 15 in 2020 and 24 last year.
 Doctors cited the Covid-19 pandemic for the fall in numbers as staff were redeployed to help with pandemic operations and transplants were postponed, especially when the patients were deemed to be at high risk.
 Ms Mai's health woes started at the age of nine when she was diagnosed with lupus. The autoimmune disease gradually caused her kidneys to fail and she was diagnosed with kidney failure in 2020.
 She did not want to undergo dialysis for the rest of her life, which involves spending four hours at a dialysis centre three times a week.
 Her husband of 10 years wanted to give her his kidney, so a transplant was the obvious step to take. The couple have an eight-year-old daughter.
 Mr Wee said: ""We made a marriage vow to love each other in sickness and in health. So there was no hesitation on my part at all to donate.""
 Ms Mai was immensely touched by his generosity. She said: ""It's giving an organ, a part of yourself. It's a very big sacrifice.""
 However, the Wees found that they were medically incompatible for a transplant.
 This meant there would be a higher risk of an acute rejection of the organ, higher risks of infections and a longer hospital stay, said Assistant Professor Hersharan Kaur Sran, medical director at the Adult Kidney Transplantation Programme at the National University Centre for Organ Transplantation.
 So the Wees said they are very thankful to find a swop match through the transplant registry.
 To prepare for the transplant, Mr Wee stepped up his exercise regimen, went on a diet and lost about 10kg to be in tip-top health at about 70kg.
 He said: ""Before her transplant, Serene was so tired and angsty. I feel that giving my kidney is worth it. I got my wife back.""
 Ms Mai said she felt so exhausted all the time after her kidneys failed that she stopped working for about a year until after her transplant.
 She said her energy levels are now back to what they were before her kidneys failed, and she currently works as a communications manager at the National Kidney Foundation.
 She is sharing her story to raise awareness that one does not have to wait for many years for a kidney from a dead donor and that a kidney swop is an alternative.
 Dr Sobhana Thangaraju, a senior consultant at the renal medicine department at Singapore General Hospital, described paired kidney exchange transplants as an ""important life buoy"" for patients who have a medically incompatible donor.
 While there are now more patients joining the registry to find a match, Dr Sobhana said the numbers remain very small as organ transplant rates here are low.
 Some patients are reluctant to join the registry as they do not know how long they would have to wait to find a suitable match, while others are not keen on receiving a kidney from a stranger they know nothing about.
 Ms Mai said: ""If you know someone close who needs a kidney and you are willing to donate, initiate the conversation rather than wait for the person to ask. In our Asian culture, people often don't want others to sacrifice (their kidney) for themselves.""
    VERY BIG SACRIFICE  It's giving an organ, a part of yourself. It's a very big sacrifice.

Channel NewsAsia
August 22, 2022 Monday 7:05 AM GMT","SINGAPORE: A 31-year-old man has died, more than a month after a car he was driving burst into flames in a Bukit Panjang car park.
The incident happened in the early hours of Jul 3. Distressing video footage circulated on social media showed the man on fire, screaming as he stumbled out of his burning car at Block 218 Petir Road.
The man was conscious when he was taken to Singapore General Hospital for burn injuries.
Police told CNA on Monday (Aug 22) that he died on Aug 11. Police investigations are ongoing.
The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) told CNA that it was alerted to the incident at about 4am, adding that a car was ""fully engulfed in flames"" when it arrived at the scene.
SCDF said it extinguished the fire using compressed air foam jets, adding that the blaze damaged three other vehicles.
The cause of the fire is under investigation, SCDF said. INITIAL: hz(gs)",Channel NewsAsia,23-08-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999957202368713}",en,0.9999957202368713

The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 23, 2022 Tuesday","A man who was in a car when it went up in flames at a carpark in Bukit Panjang has died after more than a month in hospital.
 In response to queries from The Straits Times, the police said yesterday that the 31-year-old man died on Aug 11.
 They were alerted to the incident in an open-air carpark at Block 218 Petir Road at about 4am on July 3.
 A Singapore Civil Defence Force spokesman said at the time that a car that was in a parking space was engulfed in flames when its officers arrived.
 Chinese evening daily Shin Min Daily News previously reported that the man was trying to start the vehicle when it suddenly caught fire.
 The SCDF said four compressed air foam jets were used to extinguish the fire that spread to three other vehicles and damaged them.
 The man was conscious when he was taken to Singapore General Hospital, said the police, who are investigating the incident.
 A woman who lives on the second floor of a block overlooking the carpark had said earlier that ""the entire window in front of our flat glowed bright orange, and I could feel the heat"".

264,"Jail, caning for duo who attacked man over alleged rape; Judge says allegation by wife of one assailant unproven, no room for vigilante justice here
The Straits Times (Singapore)
August 26, 2022 Friday","Two friends, who were out on bail for other offences, attacked a man with a knife, a baton and a knuckleduster after the wife of one of the assailants accused the victim of raping her.
 The attack was so vicious that the knuckleduster tore a chunk of flesh from the 29-year-old victim's head.
 The victim, who was later found with injuries including multiple stab wounds and fractures to his left foot and right forearm, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after the attack.
 But yesterday, District Judge Eddy Tham said that the rape allegation was unproven and that ""(there is) no room for vigilante justice here"".
 The woman's husband, Andre Chen Si'En, 32, was sentenced to eight years' jail with nine strokes of the cane after he pleaded guilty to two assault charges and one count of drug consumption.
 The other assailant, Gervan Wong Jun Heng, 27, pleaded guilty to 14 charges, including assault, drug abuse and traffic offences.
 Wong was yesterday sentenced to seven years, three months and 16 weeks' jail with six strokes of the cane.
 He was also fined $2,400 and disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licences for two years.
 Court documents did not disclose the reasons behind the rape allegation.
 It was not mentioned if action will be taken against Chen's wife.
 Deputy Public Prosecutor Huo Jiongrui said the victim, who was Chen's friend, did not know Wong.
 On May 9, 2020, Chen received text messages from his wife, claiming that the victim had raped her the night before.
 Chen then told Wong about the matter and the younger man agreed to accompany him to settle the matter with the victim.
 At around 9pm, Chen contacted the victim and asked him out for drinks. Chen and Wong later picked him up near his home and the pair took him to Choa Chu Kang Cemetery at around 3am on May 10, 2020.
 Chen asked the victim about the rape allegation but received what he thought were half-hearted replies from him.
 Wong and Chen then assaulted him with the weapons.
 After that, the attackers ordered the man to crawl back to a nearby car before Wong drove him home.
 His mother called for emergency services when she saw him at the doorstep.
 An ambulance took him to Singapore General Hospital and he was hospitalised until May 12 that year.",The Straits Times (Singapore),25-08-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999982785665662}",en,0.9999982785665662

Heritage brand Ka-Soh, famous for their thick and rich Cantonese-style fish soup, will be shutting the doors of one of its outlets at the end of June.
Has been winning the Michelin Bib Gourmand award​ The Ka-Soh brand, founded in 1995, has a flagship outlet located at the Alumni Medical Centre at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) in Outram, which can seat 100 people.
After calling the place home for 20 years, the restaurant's final day of operation will be on June 26, 2022.
The Outram outlet has been consistently awarded the Michelin Bib Gourmand since 2016.
The Michelin Bib Gourmand award recognises restaurants that offer good food at affordable prices, where the menu is priced at a maximum of S$45.
In their Facebook post, Ka-Soh shared that the Outram outlet was a result of two decades of hard work, which turned a &quot;challenging location into an iconic one&quot;.
The brand thanked its customers, including the medical fraternity at SGH, for their support.
Reasons for closure​ One of Ka-Soh's third-generation co-owners, Cedric Tang, revealed in an interview with Chinese media Shin Min Daily News ( Shin Min ) that the closure of the Outram outlet was a painful, yet necessary, decision.
Manpower issues are the main reason the outlet is closing, Tang said.
He shared that several longtime employees quit after the death of Tang's father and second-generation owner Tang Tat Cheong on Mar. 31.
Since borders have opened up, several Malaysian employees have also returned home.
As such, Ka-Soh had at least four vacancies for kitchen staff across both their outlets.
Additionally, Tang told Shin Min that the Outram outlet is rather old, and the conditions of equipment such as the air-conditioner and freezer were deteriorating.
Repairs would cost around S$50,000, and this financial burden was exacerbated by the rising operational costs of electricity and water.
Previously closed sister outlet​ Previously, Ka-Soh's sister eatery, Swee Kee Eating House at Amoy Street, closed its doors in May 2021.
Swee Kee shared that the effects of Covid-19 and the pandemic had been too much for their business to bear.
This was compounded by their location in the Central Business District, which saw decreased human traffic as work-from-home was made the default.
Swee Kee added that it had been sustaining monthly losses during that period.
In the meantime, Ka-Soh's other outlet at 22 Greenwood Avenue will continue to operate as per usual.

My sincere apologies to those that were turned away at the door as we had a full house.

The presentation and panel discussion by Dr Moses, Sengkang General Hospital Ms Evelyn Khoo Aphasia SG  and Dr Shamala Singapore National Stroke Association were not only informative but also gave new insights to many. The event and subsequent responses have opened my world to stroke survivors like myself needing answers to our predicament and rehabilitation needs. I hope to plan for another session so that stroke survivors and their loved ones can have the opportunity to have their queries and doubts addressed.

Whenever she spots an oversight, she sets her heart and mind to correcting it. Whether it’s to do with maintaining standards of sanitation and infection control at the Hospital, or promoting and improving the prospects of nurses in Singapore, A/Prof Lim is a tireless doer and eager advocate of change.

In person, she is self-effacing and affable. There is a mellow grandmotherly air about her, but when she speaks about nursing or other projects she’s involved in, she brims with enthusiasm and her voice is lively and rings with conviction.

Spare her the vitriol and vicious comments. Her ordeal, over the past year, is her paying the price and taking responsibility for her recklessness and complacency. 

And as for her five friends, including her best friend and fiancé, we do not in any way condone their behaviour, but before we cast our judgements, please remember that they have already paid the highest price: with their own lives - whether deserving or otherwise, it is not for us to judge. 

If we, as individuals and a society, have nothing better to say, maybe the least we can do is to not speak at all.

Raybe needs healing, so does our society. :pray: 
[Latest] Ms Raybe Oh Siew Huey, 26, is out of intensive care and conscious. She is now in a high dependency ward at Singapore General Hospital. 

We hope she can recover both physically and emotionally. :pray::pray::pray: All the best!

Even as SGH struggled to ride the whirlwinds of change in the hospital, we now had to respond to the nation’s call to provide medical support outside our four walls. The summons for us to get out of our comfort zone and help manage the increasing eruptions in the dormitories was unprecedented, but a crucial plank of the whole-of-nation response.

作为一名在紧急护理医院工作的康复医学专家，撒姆尔医生（Dr Geoffrey Samuel）常需要负责照顾重症病人–他们可能涉及严重车祸，或者患上使人日益衰弱的中风。
撒姆尔医生领导的一个多学科小组，会给予这类需要较长时间逐渐复原的病人多方面协助。自然，这类病人之前已获得所需的护理而且病情稳定。假使能让他们重新站立起来，或者最少尽可能恢复他们以前的状况，撒姆尔医生就会对自己的工作产生满足感。
他说;“我要尽所能帮助更多病人享有以往的高素质生活，帮助他们改进身体的功能。”撒姆尔高级顾问医生是在新加坡中央医院康复医学部任职。
他补充说：“复健是一个积极的过程。我们为病人制定实际的复原目标，然后与不同学科的专家协调，帮助病人达到目标。我们会给病人建议锻炼项目、最好的营养菜单及药物，以增强他们的体力和改善器官功能。”

病人毅力是关键因素

他最难忘的一个病例是一名54岁患严重肺炎的男士，他依赖呼吸机生存，住加护病房已半年。他病愈出院时，病情其实还存在好些未确定因素–他能在家独立生活吗？
很令人感到意外的是，几个月后，病人能回复日常生活，如自己到商店购买日用品。他病情的好转情况超越预期，原本以为他出门时最少需要使用一个携带式氧气浓缩器。
撒姆尔医生认为，虽然医疗小组包括职能治疗师、语言治疗师、物理治疗师、音乐治疗师和心理治疗师，都有从各个方面协助病人复健，其实最关键的还是靠病人自己的毅力改变了结果。
撒姆尔医生监督病人的复健，也为他们制定可行的康复目标，出现困难时则需协助处理如情绪、疼痛或营养等问题。如果有必要，他会转介给其他学科的专家治疗。病人情况改善，小组就会让病人出院，并安排他们使用所需的复健设施，或者以门诊方式继续接受治疗。
虽然协调不同学科专家的工作可能是一项挑战，然而，正是这一种整体的医疗方式，吸引了撒姆尔医生加入康复医学的实践。
他指出：“病人经常患有多种交互作用的疾病，开始是患肺病，接着心脏或肾脏也可能有问题，所以这些病全需要治疗。”

PHOTO: LIANHE ZAOBAO SINGAPORE - Iris Koh, founder of anti-vaccine group Healing the Divide, has made an application to go to Malaysia to seek medical treatment for thyroid cancer, the court heard on Friday (June 17). The judge said her condition did not appear to be life-threatening and called for an adjournment till June 22 before a decision is made so that information on her treatment can be provided. The application was made by her lawyer Wee Pan Lee, who said Koh, 46, suffered from cancer and had been recommended by Singapore General Hospital to undergo surgery to remove her thyroid glands to treat it. Mr Wee said: &quot;Upon receiving the news of cancer, she was devastated. She searched for an alternative to invasive removal of the thyroid glands and seized this chance to go overseas for an alternative.&quot; He provided the names of three medical and therapy centres in Malaysia where Koh planned to seek a second opinion for her treatment. Mr Wee urged the court to approve the request, adding that the only instance she should not be granted is if there was a likelihood that she would abscond. Deputy Public Prosecutor Jiang Ke Yue said he did not wish to stand in her way for Koh's desire for alternative treatment, but questioned the need for such a lengthy period of travel and the nature of the consultations at the centres provided. Asking for an adjournment, the DPP said: &quot;Where one provides more documents that raise more questions than answers, that itself lends to the inference that there is a potential flight risk. &quot;We aren't saying that there will be, but we need more information to be in a better position to agree to travel. The appropriate cause would be an adjournment.&quot; Agreeing with the prosecution, the judge said: &quot;This condition doesn't appear to be life-threatening at this point in time based on the submissions I have heard.&quot; Koh's bail was extended and she will return to court on June 22. She was charged over multiple offences earlier this year. She is accused of conspiring with general practitioner Jipson Quah to make false representations to the Ministry of Health that unvaccinated people were given the Sinopharm vaccine, when they were not. In February, she was also charged over ripping up a printed copy of her statement recorded at a police station. She was granted $20,000 bail at the time. She had been hospitalised prior to her court hearing on Jan 28 but her condition was not mentioned in court then.",forums.hardwarezone.com.sg,17-06-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999971933916784}",en,0.9999971933916784

The mercy and generosity of Emperor Cyrus regardless of race and religion stand out so beautifully, and is especially relevant in our climate today.

It brings me great comfort to know that we are equally dedicated to the service of all mankind and share the same desire to foster a harmonious society regardless of race or religion. 
 
Finally, I take great comfort and admiration for the Zoroastrian community in Singapore that in spite of their small number of about 350 Parsis, they never feel that they are too insignificant to contribute to the rest of society and humanity and be witnesses to right living.

202,SINGAPORE - A staycation to celebrate her daughter's birthday ended with a trip to the hospital when ...,"SINGAPORE - A staycation to celebrate her daughter's birthday ended with a trip to the hospital when the hotel room's glass shower door fell on Ms Suziyana Hamid and shattered, leaving her with cuts across her body.

The incident took place at Siloso Beach Resort on June 16 at about 4.30am, after a day of festivities on Sentosa to mark the daughter's 12th birthday.

Ms Suziyana said the glass shower door came off its hinges as she pulled it open.

She put her arm up to protect herself as the glass door hit her and shattered. The shards cut her on the arms, hands, chest and scalp.

Ms Suziyana, 41, a senior executive in a local non-profit organisation, said her daughter was in shock to see her in such a state and tried to console her.

&quot;When she saw me crying, she said 'Ibu (mother), it's okay, you are okay',&quot; she said.

She was later taken to the hospital, where doctors and nurses picked the glass pieces out with tweezers.

She was given two days of medical leave.

The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) confirmed it had received a call for help at Siloso Beach Resort at about 4.30am on June 16 and had taken a patient to Singapore General Hospital.

Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC), which oversees the resort island and is the hotel's landlord, said it takes the matter very seriously and will be looking into the matter, in e-mails seen by The Straits Times. SDC representatives visited the hotel room while Ms Suziyana was in the hospital.

When contacted, the hotel declined to comment.

ST understands that the police are not investigating the matter.

Ms Suziyana said her husband Reduan Nordin, 41, who works in the construction sector and was also at the hotel, had called the front desk for help after calling SCDF and a staff member delivered bandages to their room.

She added that the hotel has not contacted them since she was discharged from the hospital.

One industry expert, Mr Victor Sia, said there are several reasons why tempered glass - often used in bathroom settings - might shatter.

This could be due to the inclusion of nickel sulphide, which could result in breakage even without impact, said the research and development engineer at SG Glass.

The door could also have shattered due to the hinges exerting high mechanical stress on the glass, he said.

203,SINGAPORE - A staycation to celebrate her daughter's birthday ended with a trip to the hospital when ...,"SINGAPORE - A staycation to celebrate her daughter's birthday ended with a trip to the hospital when the hotel room's glass shower door fell on Ms Suziyana Hamid and shattered, leaving her with cuts across her body.

The incident took place at Siloso Beach Resort on June 16 at about 4.30am, after a day of festivities on Sentosa to mark the daughter's 12th birthday.

Ms Suziyana said the glass shower door came off its hinges as she pulled it open.

She put her arm up to protect herself as the glass door hit her and shattered. The shards cut her on the arms, hands, chest and scalp.

Ms Suziyana, 41, a senior executive in a local non-profit organisation, said her daughter was in shock to see her in such a state and tried to console her.

&quot;When she saw me crying, she said 'Ibu (mother), it's okay, you are okay',&quot; she said.

She was later taken to the hospital, where doctors and nurses picked the glass pieces out with tweezers.

She was given two days of medical leave.

The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) confirmed it had received a call for help at Siloso Beach Resort at about 4.30am on June 16 and had taken a patient to Singapore General Hospital.

Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC), which oversees the resort island and is the hotel's landlord, said it takes the matter very seriously and will be looking into the matter, in e-mails seen by The Straits Times. SDC representatives visited the hotel room while Ms Suziyana was in the hospital.

When contacted, the hotel declined to comment.

ST understands that the police are not investigating the matter.

Ms Suziyana said her husband Reduan Nordin, 41, who works in the construction sector and was also at the hotel, had called the front desk for help after calling SCDF and a staff member delivered bandages to their room.

She added that the hotel has not contacted them since she was discharged from the hospital. 

One industry expert, Mr Victor Sia, said there are several reasons why tempered glass - often used in bathroom settings - might shatter.

This could be due to the inclusion of nickel sulphide, which could result in breakage even without impact, said the research and development engineer at SG Glass.

The door could also have shattered due to the hinges exerting high mechanical stress on the glass, he said.

The use of tempered glass is often necessary to meet impact and safety levels, Mr Sia said, noting normal glass breaks into large shards, which pose a greater risk of injury.

204,代餐减肥安全有效吗? | 优1周 - UWeekly,"低热量的代餐，一般不适合孩童、孕妇、哺乳妈妈，以及那些患了与肝肾心相关重病的男女食用。只吃代餐类似于采用热量非常低的节食计划。这种节食也称为半饥饿或速成节食方法，是一种临床上需要监督的节食计划，每天只提供800大卡的热量。

减肥瘦身，并不总是那么容易成功的。有人要快速减除过多的体重，便选择代餐产品。
代餐可以制成奶昔、条状或菜汤，以取代完整的餐食，其含热量较低，平均每餐只得200至250大卡，因此，代餐能产生减轻体重的效果。然而，我们不应为了拥有较健康体重而以代餐完全取代正常餐饮。

不是每个人适合

新加坡中央医院营养部门的首席营养食疗师陈爱珊说：“人们在定下减少体重的目标时，还须养成健康生活习惯，这样减肥才能取得持久的成果。代餐可能有助于个别人士快速看到显著成绩，但是，他们仍需朝向养成长期健康饮食习惯的方向努力。
“要成功减轻体重及保持标准体重，必须坚持改变不良生活方式。寻求营养师的指导，能协助人们制定长期的健康饮食计划。”
低热量的代餐，一般不适合孩童、孕妇、哺乳妈妈，以及那些患了与肝肾心相关重病的男女食用。已患病者，假使要节食，特别是以非常低热量饮食取代正常饮食，应先征求医生或营养师的意见；如果真要节食，须要知道怎样安全和有效地进行。
比如，需要注射胰岛素或服用降血糖药片的糖尿病病人，便需要调整药量。低热量饮食会增加患上低血糖症的风险。
陈营养师指出：“假使代餐产品能成为限制热量的健康饮食计划的一部分，会是有用的减肥工具。”
然而，有人会不正确的使用–以代餐产品取代所有的餐饮，那便可能无法提供身体所需的热量、主要营养物质及纤维。假使在正餐外再食用代餐产品，便可能导致体重增加。有些人还可能无法忍受产品所含的乳糖或糖醇引发的副作用，如腹胀、肚子痉挛或腹泻。
只吃代餐类似于采用热量非常低的节食计划。这种节食也称为半饥饿或速成节食方法，是一种临床上需要监督的节食计划，每天只提供800大卡的热量，通常用在严重超重、准备接受减肥手术治疗者，或需要快速减肥以改善某种病情者。

溜溜球节食综合征

男生每天需摄取的热量是2200大卡，女生为1800大卡。这意味着非常低热量的饮食计划，对大多数人要保持稳定和健康体重是不恰当的。陈爱珊指出，要采用非常低热量的饮食计划，须要密切的医药关注，因为这会导致脱水、电解质异常和产生胆石。

Source: The Straits Times
Source date: 2007-7-24

A WOMAN was arrested for attempted murder just hours after a flat in Block 802, Yishun Ring Road, was set on fire at about 3pm on Sunday.
    
    Initial police investigations revealed that a suspect had bought petrol from a petrol kiosk to start the blaze.
    
    The fire engulfed footwear outside the door and quickly spread into the living room. The four occupants of the flat had to be treated for smoke inhalation and two are still in hospital.
    
    In a press statement yesterday, police said the 34-year-old suspect was a former colleague of one of the flat's residents.
    
    She had allegedly scribbled loan shark-related graffiti on the wall near the four-room flat on the 11th storey, but police said she has no links with any unlicensed money lending syndicate.
    
    The fire forced 40-year-old property agent Goh Seng Chai, his wife Madam Zhuo Huiling, and their son and daughter to seek refuge on a window ledge.
    
    Madam Zhuo, 41, and the couple's 11-year-old daughter required treatment for smoke inhalation at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. They were later discharged.
    
    Mr Goh had to brave the flames to rescue his 12-year-old son, Jun Wei, who was asleep in another bedroom.
    
    Although his right palm and left foot were scorched, he carried his son and joined the rest of the family in the master bedroom.
    
    When the smoke got too thick for them to breathe, they climbed out onto the window ledge. Their cries for help alerted neighbours and firefighters soon arrived to put out the blaze.
    
    Mr Goh is still being treated for inhalation burns at the burns unit of Singapore General Hospital. Jun Wei, who is suffering from smoke inhalation, is in KK Women's and Children's Hospital.
    
    The couple also have a five-month-old daughter, who was at her grandmother's house on Sunday.
    
    Police said that setting fire with malicious intent is a serious crime. If convicted, the suspect could be jailed for life.",facebook.com,24-06-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999951183119733}",en,0.9999951183119733

这起事件发生在6月16日凌晨4时30分，地点是喜乐圣淘沙度假旅馆（Siloso Beach Resort）。在非盈利组织工作的高级执行人员苏吉雅娜（41岁）接受访问时说：“若这事情发生在我女儿或父母身上，后果更不堪设想。”

这起事件发生在喜乐圣淘沙度假旅馆。（档案照）

苏吉雅娜透露，为庆祝女儿12岁生日，一家人包括姐妹以及父母，在度假旅馆订了七个房间。他们于6月15日下午登记入住，接着为女儿庆生，直到午夜12时许女儿才入睡。由于仍有工作要处理，苏吉雅娜一直忙到凌晨4时许，才去洗澡准备休息。岂料，洗完澡后，浴室玻璃门一度打不开，她呼叫丈夫帮忙，怎知玻璃门瞬间爆裂。

苏吉雅娜洗完澡后，玻璃门突然爆裂，导致她身上多处被划伤。（受访者提供）

“我下意识用手护脸，玻璃碎片割伤了头皮、手臂、胸口等。”

当时苏吉雅娜一身赤裸，玻璃碎片溅落在她身上，丈夫和妹妹原想帮她包上毛巾，但因为太过疼痛，所以只能等医护人员抵达后再处理。

“我当时吓哭了，女儿也被吵醒，甚至忍不住哭泣。不过，女儿还会不断安慰我说‘没事的，妈妈你没事的’。”

民防部队受询时说，他们于6月16日凌晨4时30分接到求助电话，一人被送往新加坡中央医院诊治。

旅馆：将调查事件

妇女不满旅馆没有紧急应对措施，旅馆负责人说，认真看待此事，并在第一时间赶到医院了解情况。

喜乐圣淘沙度假旅馆负责人回复《新明日报》询问时说，当时值班的资深职员接到旅馆住户来电后，立即派人去了解情况。除了叫救护车外，也通知圣淘沙看守员（ranger）请他们带路，以便帮助救护车在最短的时间内抵达。负责人也说，十多年来都没有发生过这样的事件，而旅馆约两年前才重新装修，接下来将着手调查，避免同样事情再次发生。

苏吉雅娜说，丈夫当时打电话到旅馆前台求助，发现没有值班经理。对此，旅馆负责人指，他们当时安排资深职员值班，事发后保修部门的主管也已在数分钟内抵达。苏吉雅娜认为，旅馆应该针对紧急情况做出更完善的应对措施，给予顾客更好的帮助。

身上五处被割伤

伤口达八公分长

苏吉雅娜身上多处被割伤，约有五处伤口，包括手臂内侧一道八公分的伤口，但所幸伤口不深。另外，医生在她右眉毛上方发现一道小伤口，提醒她若眼睛不适，必须再去看医生。

“我原本以为无大碍，但事发后我晚上睡不好，专注工作时会感到胸口闷及难呼吸，医生后来建议我去看心理医生。”

她也说，现在看到孩子在任何玻璃门前嬉闹，都会感到害怕。

255,控制三高 防肾衰竭,"在本地，引发肾衰竭的最常见原因是糖尿病、慢性炎症和高血压。病人可通过洗肾或接受肾脏移植改善病情。两种洗肾法有何不同？洗肾期间，患者、家人及看护者须注意些什么？

肾脏约有拳头大小，位于腹部深处，肋骨的下方，主要作用是由血液中过滤和分解代谢物与电解质，与身体多余的水分结合成为尿液，排出体外，从而保持体内水分平衡。肾脏也有调节血压，制造红血球和保持骨骼健康的作用。

慢性肾功能衰竭通常是肾脏工作效率在长时间内逐渐下降所致。引起慢性肾功能衰竭的原因很多，在某些情况下，肾衰竭是由突发性肾功能衰竭（急性肾功能衰竭）导致的。

新加坡中央医院肾脏科高级顾问医生林慈薇接受《联合早报》访问时说，肾衰竭是由肾脏组织损伤所引起。在本地，引发肾衰竭的最常见原因是糖尿病、慢性炎症和高血压，这些病症会导致肾脏血管和组织受到损害。因此，控制三高，是正确的保肾护肾之道。

林慈薇说，肾衰竭最初可能毫无症状。在某些情况下，肾脏病患可能会排出带血的尿液，或因为蛋白质的存在而出现泡沫尿，都可能代表肾功能受损。

到了肾衰竭末期，一些病患会感到呼吸困难，或由于体液滞留而导致腿部肿胀，或出现恶心、食欲不振、昏昏欲睡等情况。每个人的症状表现可能不同，建议有这些症状者应及早检查与治疗。

洗肾与肾脏移植的目的

当肾脏无法正常操作时，身体就会无法有效地排除水分和废物。一旦体内废物和毒素堆积过多，将导致身体细胞、组织和器官遭受永久性伤害和无法痊愈。为延长生命，病人必须洗肾或接受肾脏移植。

洗肾和肾脏移植的主要目的，是为了取代患者本身的肾脏的部分功能，预防与延缓肾衰竭。不过，当损害已无可逆转时，洗肾和肾脏移植也不再有作用。

洗肾可分为血液透析（俗称“洗血”）和腹膜透析（俗称“洗水”），这两种洗肾方式都是为了清除体内过多的液体和毒素。不同之处在于，血液透析是将身体中的血液引流到透析仪中“清洗”，净化后的血液再输送回人体；而腹膜透析则是利用腹膜来进行“清洗”，以排除病人体内的废物和过多水分。

林慈薇说，肾内科医生一般会根据患者的个人健康状况、生活方式，以及病患的选择来推荐合适的洗肾方式。

居家洗肾好处多

一些病患选择在家里洗肾，她认为居家洗肾有许多好处，在安排洗肾时间上更具灵活性。疫情期间，在家洗肾也可减少外出受感染的风险。

一些病患在接受血液透析治疗时可能遇到通道堵塞问题。林慈薇解释，这可能与血管损伤或个人血管解剖结构有关，这类病患可能需要经常接受干预治疗和住院来处理通道堵塞问题。

林慈薇说：“洗肾或许很麻烦，有些人在洗肾后会感到疲惫。即便洗肾，也不是所有的肾衰竭并发症都能得到缓解，病人仍须注意饮食，定期服药。病人也须做好自我护理，照顾好洗肾通道，并尽可能保持健康的生活方式，包括：注意饮食和运动，这对减少肾衰竭和洗肾的副作用很重要。”

洗肾考验的不只是患者的身体，还有患者和家人的耐心。看护者须确保肾衰竭患者持续洗肾和用药，并处理患者生病时的情绪压力。必要时，看护者也要注意自我护理，或寻求帮助。

至于肾衰竭患者在治疗或康复期间饮食上须做哪些改变与调整？林慈薇说，饮食建议是根据肾病的阶段，其他并发疾病，如：糖尿病、高血脂和高血压，以及病人的营养需求来决定。一般来说，肾衰竭患者建议减少饮食中的钠摄取量，并让营养师为病人制定针对性的饮食方案。 ...",zaobao.com.sg,28-06-2022,"{'language': 'zh-cn', 'score': 0.9999983567611954}",zh-cn,0.9999983567611954

258,中央医院试验动静脉内瘘替代传统手术 助患者洗肾 - 8world,"为了帮助末期肾病患者洗肾，中央医院展开试验计划，采用非手术性的动静脉内瘘替代传统手术，减去病人在洗肾前开刀的步骤，成功率达到90%。

患有肾病需长期洗肾的人，必须先动手术在手臂的动脉和静脉之间，建立一个血管通路，但手术容易导致血栓形成。中央医院于是展开三年试验计划，采用动静脉内瘘的非手术性方式，替代传统手术。

钟一领去年8月就接受了这个新医疗方案。“一个针直接插进这个血管，他们说我的血管比较露在外面所以比较容易当时做了三个月后就开始洗肾。”

新加坡中央医院肾科主任兼高级顾问医生陈确帅副教授表示：“不需要动大手术也不需要留疤痕，没有伤口所以复原的机会也比较快，感染细菌的几率也比较低。普通的手术的成功率在新加坡高达78%，所以这90%相比之下比较高一点。有些病患他们的血管太小，这种方法就不太适合了。”

医生表示患者也会有血管变窄的情况，接受传统手术的患者有60%每一年都需要回来复诊。而新方案能减少血管阻塞的几率，患者每两年只需复诊一次。

2011年到2020年之间，本地需要洗肾的患者从4000多人增加到7000多人。医生估计新方案可省下一半的医疗成本。预计200名病患将在试验计划下受惠。 ...",8world.com,28-06-2022,"{'language': 'zh-cn', 'score': 0.99999591226092}",zh-cn,0.99999591226092

Their optimism comes from a grounded sense of what is possible, from having gone back to basics to address problems at root cause and putting in place the necessary changes and reinforcements. Whether it’s preparedness for this pandemic or the next, whether it’s research and education for higher clinical standards and raising healthcare in Singapore to the next level, there is much to cherish and good cause for hope.

74岁的雷蒙德三年前曾心跳骤停倒卧家中。幸好儿子杰克逊及时发现并拨打995求助。在调度员的指导下，他第一次使用心肺复苏术，成功抢救父亲。

杰克逊说：“第一次心肺复苏他没有苏醒，我按指示更用力压，然后听到肋骨骨折的声音，调度员叫我不要担心，这代表我有施力，之后他开始恢复心跳。”

接到通知之后，救护车一般会在十分钟内抵达现场。但这段时间也是急救黄金期，每流失一分钟，心跳骤停患者的生存率就会下跌7%到10%。

虽然院外心跳骤停个案从2011年的1300起增加到2020年的3400多起，但旁人进行心肺复苏的比率也翻倍，从2011年的22%增至2020年的56%。公众使用自动心脏除颤器的比率也从2%增加到9%。

泛亚洲心肺复苏注册与结果研究项目主席兼新加坡中央医院紧急医学高级顾问医生王英福教授说：“生存率也是加了一倍。所以我要鼓励大家，我们要继续学做心肺复苏，利用我们的myResponder应用，还有敢敢地去用自动心脏除颤器，拯救更多的生命。”

17岁学生李哲恺就曾九度响应求救通报，赶到现场为心跳骤停者提供救援。

74岁的雷蒙德三年前曾心跳骤停倒卧家中。幸好儿子杰克逊及时发现并拨打995求助。在调度员的指导下，他第一次使用心肺复苏术，成功抢救父亲。

杰克逊说：“第一次心肺复苏他没有苏醒，我按指示更用力压，然后听到肋骨骨折的声音，调度员叫我不要担心，这代表我有施力，之后他开始恢复心跳。”

接到通知之后，救护车一般会在十分钟内抵达现场。但这段时间也是急救黄金期，每流失一分钟，心跳骤停患者的生存率就会下跌7%到10%。

虽然院外心跳骤停个案从2011年的1300起增加到2020年的3400多起，但旁人进行心肺复苏的比率也翻倍，从2011年的22%增至2020年的56%。公众使用自动心脏除颤器的比率也从2%增加到9%。

泛亚洲心肺复苏注册与结果研究项目主席兼新加坡中央医院紧急医学高级顾问医生王英福教授说：“生存率也是加了一倍。所以我要鼓励大家，我们要继续学做心肺复苏，利用我们的myResponder应用，还有敢敢地去用自动心脏除颤器，拯救更多的生命。”

17岁学生李哲恺就曾九度响应求救通报，赶到现场为心跳骤停者提供救援。

“病人的家属在这种情况，可能会很着急也不会反应过来，所以有我们，对病人的家属带来很多安慰。” ...",huaren.sg,22-05-2022,"{'language': 'zh-cn', 'score': 0.9999965919380742}",zh-cn,0.9999965919380742
341,中央医院首次用3D打印技术 成功医治胸部畸形个案 - 8world,"新加坡中央医院首次使用3D打印技术，为胸腔凹陷的人重建胸腔，成功医治胸部畸形的个案。院方也将成立3D打印技术中心，以治疗各种骨折的案例。

21岁的叶骏杰一出生就胸骨向内凹陷。他热爱运动但经常觉得呼吸困难。因为外形不同也让他产生自卑感。

叶骏杰说：“当兵的时候需要脱衣服这种情况就觉得很尴尬。我需要驾坦克车，坦克车里面的空间很小当时也是要戴口罩，所以我就觉得喘不过气了。”

叶骏杰曾接受传统的矫正手术，医生在他的胸骨置入金属板，把塌陷的地方往外推。不过这项手术容易造成疼痛、钢板移位等问题。去年12月在医生的建议下，他接受了全新的手术方案。团队通过电脑断层扫描将叶骏杰胸腔凹陷的部位，用3D打印技术模拟重建。

新加坡中央医院整形手术高级顾问医生周康益医生表示：“那我们可以计算他的不对称的地方有多少，算出来之后我们就从他的大腿拿骨髓放在假体上，两年后这个假体会慢慢地被吸收，剩下的就是他的骨髓。我们预算三年后这个就变成他自己的骨头。”

新加坡中央医院3D打印技术中心临床主管陈邦伟医生说：“3D打印技术中心还有一项作用，是整合各形式的3D打印医疗设备的开发把制造这些器材到准备就绪之间的时间从好几个月缩短到几个星期。”

3D打印技术中心预计年底之前成立，可为出现复杂性骨折的人提供治疗，也能让医生在手术前熟悉运作。 ...",8world.com,22-05-2022,"{'language': 'zh-cn', 'score': 0.9999980317072182}",zh-cn,0.9999980317072182

Such patients need ventilator support, via a machine that delivers oxygen into their lungs. The severe form of the novel infection was, ultimately, a pneumonia.

The first paper from Wuhan, published in The Lancet on 24 January 2020, indicated that 29% of 41 people who caught the virus ended up being unable to breathe on their own, requiring ICU care.

Today, with the large worldwide experience, we know that a much smaller percentage end up in the ICU. The figure is even smaller for the vaccinated who suffer a breakthrough infection.

What has sustained him all these years is his ‘motivation to want to help people, to want to be there for those who are less fortunate.’ He looks happy when he says he is prepared to carry on working as long as he can still walk. ‘My wife has retired, but I want to carry on!’

With the strong winds that afternoon, the fire quickly intensified, engulfing the settlement and forcing residents to flee.

Survivors of the fire remember the chaos and trauma of that afternoon. In an interview with CNA, one survivor remembers carrying her four-month old baby as they ran from the flames, and another recalled their shock and panic.

180 firemen, 20 officers, 22 fire engines were quickly deployed to fight the fire, and nearly 1,000 army personnel arrived to control the crowd. But Bukit Ho Swee was devastated: 4 people died, 85 were injured, around 16,000 were left homeless, and more than 2,200 houses destroyed.

A collective, community spirit emerged from the ashes. Some of the first-responders who put out the blaze were Singapore Civil Defence Force volunteers who served in the Auxiliary Fire Service. Singaporeans also came together to support relief efforts and raise funds for those who had lost their homes in the fire.

After the fire, army trucks delivered 6,000 blankets, 3,000 mattresses, and food and cutlery to relief centres. Singapore General Hospital, along with other organisations, set up a clinic at Kim Seng West School and treated more than 200 cases in the first six hours. Volunteers also helped to man food and drink lines at the relief centres.

In the years after, efforts to rebuild the lives of the Bukit Ho Swee families continued. By Feb 1962, they were given new homes in Queenstown, Tiong Bahru and Kallang. The fire was also the impetus for the government to build safer homes for Singaporeans. So by 1967, Bukit Ho Swee was developed into a new residential area with modern flats.

The Bukit Ho Swee fire is now known by many as one of the biggest fires in Singapore. But it was also an incident that demonstrated a tenacity that comes when we band together through adversity, and pick one another up. It showed that we are — and have always been — stronger, together. #WeAreTotalDefence

Dr Hairil is currently completing his PhD in Clinical and Translational Sciences at Duke-NUS and a senior consultant at the Singapore General Hospital department of anaesthesiology.

On receiving the award, Dr Hairil said, “honestly, I wasn’t expecting to win. In fact, I only realised the significance of the award during the interview, and when people started congratulating me. I feel honoured for sure as it is an acknowledgment and recognition of my past contributions as well as my ability to contribute further.

I’m now creating the largest perioperative and critical care relational database of patients undergoing surgery in the region and state-of-the-art machine learning models to predict surgical complications. This is perfectly aligned to my job as an Anaesthesiologist and Perioprerative Physician, which is to reduce complications, especially in elderly with multiple medical problems. When completed, it would be the backbone for many real-world healthcare data science-related research coming out of Singapore.

In the next few years, I will also focus on mentoring my team to scale up the sub-specialty of peri-operative medicine in Singapore as a way to pay it forward, for I had many good mentors when I was still a junior doctor.”

恐惧感能使人避开危险，但也可能失控。病态的恐惧感是能治疗的。

这里先说个真实例子。安娜在这次的冠病疫情期间，从澳大利亚回来新加坡探访年迈的双亲，需要先住进酒店隔离14天。然而，过了一个星期，她内心开始感到恐慌，心跳剧烈加速，胸闷，而且产生强烈焦虑感。

安娜经历的就是恐惧症，一种无端端却很强烈的恐慌感觉。其实，她住的酒店条件很好，也能和家入通过视频和电话交谈。不过，她宣称不能当面接触，不能呼吸到新鲜空气，恐惧就来袭。

3%人有恐惧症

世界各地有许多人，也在隔离期间出现与安娜相似的症状。隔离产生的恐惧对他们或许很不平常，然而，生活里的恐惧感一般却没少发生。新加坡中央医院精神病学高级顾问医生林英尊副教授，引述《精神失常诊断与统计手册》说，世界约3%的人口，最少患有100种常见恐惧症中的一种。

它们包括：社交恐惧、惧高、密闭空间恐惧等。有些恐惧症是与生俱来的，如对巨大声响感到害怕；再如害怕跌倒，便有助于儿童避开危险。

另一些恐惧源自创伤性事件。林副教授指出：“比如你曾受困于火车或隧道里，过后对密闭空间便容易产生恐惧感。”

许多人是通过林副教授所谓的条件反射或错误学习而患上恐惧症，比如困在没有空调设施的电梯，可能会感到气闷，如果这时还让非理性想法占据脑袋，焦虑情绪就会越来越严重。这时候，受困者不是镇定地等待救援，而是幻想着“假使电缆断了怎么办”，恐惧情绪就会不断增长。
有人会对狗产生恐惧感，可能因为有一次被一只过于热情的狗扑到胸前而吓坏。假使他不处理这种恐惧感，他今后可能对其他动物如猫也会害怕起来。勇敢面对恐惧是最好的克服恐惧感的方法。林英尊高级顾问医生说：“坚持面对恐惧最少一到一个半小时，恐惧感就会逐渐消失。”
至于那些不能自己克服恐惧情绪者，可以寻求医药治疗。林副教授补充说，通过辅导和认知行为治疗，恐惧症是能治愈的。

496,"Access to #healthcare services has evolved tremendously over the past few years, partly due to technological ...","Access to #healthcare services has evolved tremendously over the past few years, partly due to technological advancements and the COVID-19 pandemic. 

In 2021, Singapore’s Centre for Healthcare Innovation (CHI) and Temasek Foundation held the Healthcare InnoMatch for startups looking to provide #innovative solutions to help the elderly amongst other groups. Our ACE member Rootally AI emerged as one of the top three teams! 

The startup developed AllyCare, an AI-based tele-rehab solution. Using deep learning algorithms designed for physiotherapy exercises, AllyCare delivers tailored exercises prescribed by a patient’s physiotherapist and enables him/her to perform their exercises while guided by a virtual trainer who also provides real-time feedback.

What’s the story behind this solution? 

With an ageing population comes a growing demand for rehabilitation services in Singapore. Even with an increase in centre-based care facilities, there are manpower challenges, environmental barriers and operational constraints. 
 
Rootally AI’s CEO Amit Jindal realised that his grandmother’s physiotherapy appointments were being postponed during the pandemic. He noticed the inconvenience and time-consuming process of follow-up visits and was determined to find a solution. Armed with his knowledge in AI, Amit developed the remote treatment app that allows therapists to monitor the progress of patients from the hospital. 

Not only does AllyCare help to reduce the hassle of travelling to healthcare facilities for the elderly, it also increases the accessibility of physiotherapy. It is currently being trialled at the Singapore General Hospital and will soon be test bedded in KK Women's and Children's Hospital.

代表律师庭上称，女医生向来做事细心，这事件与她一贯的性格不符，她可能因为在冠病期间任职前线，精神压力倍增而分心。

新加坡中央医院高级顾问黄丽明（66岁）今天（6月7日）承认一项驾驶时没有顾及其他公路使用者安全的罪名。她于2020年7月8日早上约6时50分，在芽笼路朝加冷路方向行驶的路段，撞伤29岁的男行人。

案情显示，被告事发时从加冷路左转进入基里玛路（Guillemard Road），当时交界处亮着允许汽车通行的绿灯。男子则在这时走过行人道，从汽车的左边走到右边。

庭上播出的电眼画面显示，当时下着雨且道路湿滑，男行人正撑伞过马路，出现在汽车的前方，但被告继续往前行驶，将他撞倒。

男子事后被送往樟宜综合医院，医疗报告显示他的后脑勺骨折，脑部也出血，医院发给他约一个月病假。

代表律师求情时称因为当时下雨，路况没有那么清晰，并指男行人在行人绿灯闪烁时才开始过马路，也算疏忽行事，不能把责任全归咎于被告。

意外发生后，女医生也马上给予援助，以专业知识评估伤者的伤势，并为他电召救护车。律师指这是被告14年驾驶经验里首次出车祸，基于以上因素，他恳请法官将罚款判为2500元。

控方反驳时说，无论当时的天气如何，被告都有安全驾驶的责任。另外，虽然被告的同事纷纷为她写人格证明书，控方指这不应该影响判决，因为车祸通常都因为一时疏忽发生，法庭须阻遏疏忽驾驶的行为。

法官下判时同意被告的罪责不高，但考虑到车祸导致行人的显著伤害，最终判她免坐牢，罚款4000元，及吊销执照五年。（人名译音） ...",zaobao.com.sg,08-06-2022,"{'language': 'zh-cn', 'score': 0.9999967155657613}",zh-cn,0.9999967155657613

It was a sunny Sunday noon, like any other normal weekends in Singapore. Yet a tragic case happened and shocked the Singapore society; an unsolved case that still baffles many till this day, even after 43 years.

On 17 September 1972, at around 1230pm, 22-year-old Malaysian seamstress Chan Chee Chan (Zeng Lizhen, 曾麗珍) suddenly screamed and collapsed at Queen’s Circus. She had suffered a gunshot at her chest, while walking back from a shopping centre to her Tanglin Halt flat with her younger sister Chan Kim Moy (Zeng Jinmei, 曾锦梅).

The Tragedy

A passing-by police patrol car immediately attended to her and called an ambulance. With blood gushing out of the wound, Chan Chee Chan was rushed to the Singapore General Hospital. The hospital staff at first thought she was stabbed, but it was later diagnosed as a wound caused by a gunshot. She was shot slightly above her chest, and the bullet entered her heart after deflected by a bone. Chan Chee Chan was pronounced dead at the hospital after 11 hours of unconsciousness.

The bullet extracted from Chan Chee Chan’s wound was of .22 calibre. The police, initially suspected that it was fired from a flat within Tanglin Halt, proposed two theories; a sharpshooter or sniper, with a score to settle, aimed and shot her from a flat. Or it could be a case of an accidental discharge of a rifle, perhaps, from someone while he was cleaning his weapon.

The shooting was later classified as a murder case by the police, and a big hunt was launched to nab the mysterious Queenstown gunman. Witnesses, whether they had seen the shooting or heard the gunshot, were appealed to come forward. Hundreds of residents living at Tanglin Halt were interviewed. Other investigations were also carried out, including the checking of firearms’ licenses.

Unlike today, private firearm licenses were abundant from the fifties to seventies. By the early seventies, there were still more than 5,000 firearm owners in Singapore, although the majority was owned by the various gun clubs’ members. Almost of half of the firearms accounted for were shotguns, followed by 1000-plus rifles. Revolvers, pistols and air rifles made up the remaining. At Queenstown, there were several registered gun owners living at Queenstown. By Monday 19 September 1972, seven guns were seized and ballistic tests were conducted, but the results proved to be negative. More islandwide raids were then conducted by the police.

More Theories

The shooting case dominated the newspapers’ headlines for days.

Who was the murderer? What was his motive? Or was it an accident?

An unnamed firearm expert came forward to propose a new theory. He believed that the weapon used was a .22 pistol or revolver instead of a .22 rifle, and the bullet was shot at a close range, possibly from a passing car at Queen’s Circus. He cited two reasons. First, if a .22 rifle was used, a telescopic lens would be required as the nearest block of flats was more than 150 yards (approximately 137m) away. According to the expert, he did not know anyone in Singapore who possessed a telescopic lens.

Secondly, a .22 game-hunter’s bullet would have penetrated the victim’s chest and left a gaping hole in her back. A target practice bullet, although it would not have penetrated the body, would have to be fired very accurately. It was very unlikely that the gunman could make his kill with only a single precise shot. Hence, the firearm expert deduced that the gunman was hired to kill the victim, and had followed and shot her at Queen’s Circus.

Another speculation was that it might be a case of wrong identity, in which the target was actually Chan Chee Chan’s sister Chan Kim Moy, and the assassin was her rejected suitor or a hired killer.

Unsolved Case

queenstown shooting3 1972Chan Chee Chan was from Kluang, Malaysia, and had nine siblings and a longtime boyfriend. She had been in Singapore since 1970, working as a seamstress at East Coast and living at a relative’s home at Tanglin Halt with her two sisters Kim Moy and Loy Koon. Upon hearing the tragic news, Chan Chee Chan’s mother, elder sister and brother rushed to Singapore. The mother, devastated by the loss of her daughter, claimed the body from the mortuary on Tuesday morning to bring back to Kluang for burial.

The forensic report submitted in 1973 concluded the case as unsolved. Since then, it has been more than four decades. The case remains open today, and the murderer, if there was ever one, is still at large all these years. Hopefully, the victim’s family could move on in life with their departed rested in peace.

The speed limit for Tanjong Pagar Road is 50kmh, Traffic Police investigator Senior Staff Sergeant Muhammad Firdaus Suleiman testified on Thursday (June 9) before State Coroner Adam Nakhoda. He added that an autopsy showed that the driver - Mr Jonathan Long Junwei, 29 - had a blood-alcohol reading of 86milligrams of alcohol per 100ml of blood. This exceeded the legal limit of 80mg per 100ml. Mr Long was driving a white BMW M4 at around 5.40am when it crashed into a shophouse before bursting into flames. Mr Long and four passengers - Mr Teo Qi Xiang, 26; Mr Elvin Tan Yong Hao, 28; Mr Eugene Yap Zheng Min, 29; and Mr Gary Wong Hong Chieh, 29 - were killed in the incident. His fiancee, former air stewardess Raybe Oh Siew Huey, 26, rushed to the scene to try to help the occupants and was badly burnt in the incident. She spent four months in Singapore General Hospital (SGH) and will need multiple reconstructive surgical operations to help her recover from her injuries. Four of the occupants of the car were working as financial advisers at Aviva Financial Advisers. Mr Wong was a former representative there. The Straits Times earlier reported that Ms Oh and the occupants of the car had dined at a nearby Korean eatery before the accident. Security camera footage showed the vehicle travelling down Tanjong Pagar Road before it crashed into the shophouse. It burst into flames seconds later. Ms Oh was seen in mobile phone footage running into the flames to try and save the men. She emerges seconds later covered in flames. The Land Transport Authority looked into the road conditions in Tanjong Pagar following the tragedy and subsequently installed more traffic-calming measures such as road dividers as well as pedestrian crossings.

A resilient healthcare system, an effective public health response, and a high degree of public trust — these made a big difference for us during the pandemic. We must also not forget the valuable lessons learnt from our COVID-19 experience, and use them to better prepare for the next crisis, be it Disease X or something else. 

Looking ahead, we must keep up our high standards of medical excellence, develop our emphasis on public health, and nurture the precious reservoir of public trust in our healthcare system and society.

632,李显龙总理：我国抗疫过程中 信任是关键,"（早报讯）在新加坡抗击冠病的过程中，人民对政府和医疗体系的高度信任以及彼此的互信发挥了关键作用。李显龙总理指出，这种信任必须不断发扬和加强，以攻克未来更严重的大流行病等挑战。

李总理今晚（4月24日）受邀在香格里拉大酒店举行的新加坡中央医院客卿讲演兼晚宴发表演说时说，我国的抗疫之路能安全顺利地走到这一步，有赖三大要素：坚韧的医疗系统、有效的公共卫生应对措施，以及人民对政府和彼此的高度信任。

李总理说，在一场公共卫生危机中，人民对医疗体系的信任至关重要。民众相信医护人员的专业和无私奉献的精神，医疗体系在出现过失时，也会开诚布公地向民众解释。

他强调，过去数十年来建立的强大信任，使新加坡有别于其他国家。我国必须继续加强这种信任，保持医疗体系的高度透明和专业能力。

此外，我国也须维持卓越的医疗水准，作为坚韧医疗系统的支柱，并进一步加强对公共卫生的重视。这包括为医护人员提供支持和提升专业技能，以及拓展医疗基础设施。

我国将在2030年之前增设九家综合诊疗所以及六家急症和社区医院，同时深化我国过去20年来建立的研发能力和生物医学专才。

大流行病也凸显了公共卫生专业知识的重要。李总理指出，我国必须了解新的疾病如何传播，通过建模预测疾病趋势，以及通过非医疗的干预措施来管控疫情。

我国下来也会把医疗重心转向基层和预防医疗，尤其是减低人口老龄化和慢性疾病带来的负担。卫生部将从明年起逐步落实“健康SG”（Healthier ...",zaobao.com.sg,24-04-2022,"{'language': 'zh-cn', 'score': 0.9999964570797855}",zh-cn,0.9999964570797855

639,李总理：抗疫过程中互信是关键 信任须不断加强以克服未来挑战,"李总理指出，我国的抗疫之路能安全顺利地走到这一步，有赖三大要素：坚韧的医疗系统、有效的公共卫生应对措施，以及人民对政府和彼此的高度信任。

在新加坡抗击冠病的过程中，人民对政府的高度信任，以及彼此的互信发挥了关键作用。李显龙总理指出，这种多年来建立起的信任须不断发扬和加强，以克服未来更严重的大流行病等挑战。

李总理昨晚出席在香格里拉大酒店举行的新加坡中央医院客卿讲演会暨晚宴。他在发表演说时指出，我国的抗疫之路能安全顺利地走到这一步，有赖三大要素：坚韧的医疗系统、有效的公共卫生应对措施，以及人民对政府和彼此的高度信任。

李总理强调，社会对政府和医疗体系的信任，对公共卫生和医疗成果至关重要。他引述医学期刊《柳叶刀》的一项研究说，人民对政府的信任度越高，就越愿意遵守防疫措施，冠病疫苗接种率也更高。“因为有了信任这份最宝贵的资源，新加坡人才能在疫情期间，团结一致，齐心抗疫，而不是相互对抗。”

李总理也说，我国过去数十年来建立的强大信任，使新加坡有别于其他国家。我国必须继续加强这种信任，并且保持医疗系统的高度透明。民众相信医护人员的专业，也相信医疗系统在出现失误时，会开诚布公地解释。

他举例，卫生部定期发布接种冠病疫苗后出现严重不良反应者的数据，当执行上出现失误或有人注射错误的疫苗剂量，当局也会主动调查并向公众解释。

“一些人可能认为，保持沉默或许比较容易，以免发布坏消息引起不必要的恐慌。这是方便的权宜之计，但非常不明智。若我们保持沉默，一两次或许行得通，不过一旦谣言传开，人们会逐渐对医疗体系失去信心。我们最终会因失去公众的信任，付出高昂的代价。”

李总理在疫情期间曾多次强调信任的重要。他在上月24日的全国讲话中也提到，我国能沉着应战的关键因素，是人民对政府和卫生当局的信任，以及对彼此的互信。

此外，我国也须维持卓越的医疗水准，作为坚韧医疗系统的支柱，并进一步加强对公共卫生的重视。这包括为医护人员提供支持和提升专业技能，定期检讨医护人员的薪金配套，以及拓展医疗基础设施。

李总理也说，我国将在2030年之前，增设九家综合诊疗所，以及六家急症和社区医院，并且深化我国过去20年来建立起的研发能力和生物医学专才。

大流行病也凸显了公共卫生专业知识的重要。李总理指出，我国必须了解新的疾病如何传播，利用建模预测疾病趋势，以及通过非医疗的干预措施来管控疫情。

Working with dietitians to plan menus for patients is a central part of his job and eating healthily has become second nature to him. Before he joined SGH in September 2002, he had worked in the kitchens of a culinary school and a few restaurants. He chose to come to SGH because he wanted a change of environment.

His eyes widen as he shares his first impressions: ‘At my previous job, I was cooking a lot. I wanted to try something different. But after I started at SGH, I got a shock. I had to think about policy, procedures, and fill in lots of forms; a lot more paperwork compared to my previous job at a hotel. The other thing is that over here, every day, there will be some new problems to solve.’

英国科学期刊《自然》（Nature）刊登的最新研究，就明确指出气候变暖和新病毒之间的关联，而其直接后果，就是大大提高了人类日后感染新病毒的风险。

753,社论：落实“健康SG”刻不容缓,"本地去年的医疗保健消费物价指数低于2019年的水平，显示去年医疗服务的价格下降。医疗保健消费物价指数是由药物、保健产品、门诊服务、医院服务和医药保险的价格和收费组成。若以2019年为基准，药物和保健产品的价格，以及综合诊疗所、全科诊所和专科门诊的收费都下跌了；医药保险以及住院病房、住院治疗和手术服务的费用则增加。

医疗保健消费物价指数降低，可归功于政府推出的多项津贴，例如立国一代配套以及加强社保援助计划（简称CHAS），包括推出CHAS绿卡，让全民不论收入都能在CHAS诊所享有慢性病医疗津贴。然而，医疗保健消费物价指数下降，只是冠病疫情期间的特殊现象，人口老龄化导致的公共医疗支出持续增长，才是不可逆的长期趋势。

去年疫情中本地医疗保健消费物价指数的下降，意味着政府开支的增加。我国每年的财政预算中，医疗保健开支的逐年上升早已是既成事实。今年2月公布的我国2022年财政预算声明预估，到了2030年，政府开支料将增至占国内生产总值两成以上，增加的支出大部分用在医疗保健。

财政部长黄循财说，医疗保健需求会随着人口老龄化而增长，我国须改造医疗保健生态系统，以满足不同护理环境对老年护理的需求，医疗保健将是未来10年促使社会支出增加的主要因素。

卫生部日前宣布，即将推出9000万元的津贴，旨在推动人口健康方面的研究与创新，尤其针对促进健康、预防性保健，以及卫生服务方面的研究。当局希望这个津贴能支持更多创新人口健康研究的研究员，以推进“健康SG”计划，并且突破我国在促进健康、预防性保健、卫生服务方面的传统做法。

上个月底，李显龙总理在新加坡中央医院的晚宴上说，我国的抗疫之路能安全顺利地走到今天，有赖于三大要素：坚韧的医疗系统、有效的公共卫生应对措施，以及人民对政府和彼此的高度信任。他强调，我国必须继续加强政府与人民之间的信任，保持医疗体系的高度透明和专业能力。

新加坡抗疫的成果建立在一个不断强化的医疗体系，充足的政府拨款之外，政府也必须掌握医疗领域的科技发展，以及应付人口变化所带来的需求。要保持医疗体系的韧性，关键之一是控制需求。这就意味着我国今后会把医疗重心转向基层和预防医疗，尤其是减低人口老龄化和慢性疾病所带来的负担。因应这一目标，“健康SG”全国策略从明年起逐步推行，鼓励每个新加坡人固定看同一名全科医生，包括定期体检和商讨护理计划。

把“健康SG”化为现实，李总理说，这须要政府和许多利益相关方的努力、思维上的转变，以及重新定位整个系统的运作方式。我国将在2030年之前增设九家综合诊疗所，以及六家急症和社区医院，同时深化我国过去20年来所建立的研发能力和生物医学专才。这是为了减轻综合医院的负担，方便民众及早看病，避免延误治疗而必须在综合医院处理恶化的病情。

病从浅中医，要贯彻这一思维，政府也许可考虑将中医纳入基本医疗体系中，让特别是有慢性病的年长者能够保持基本健康。此外，配套的做法还包括通过社区组织，举办更多适合年长者的活动来鼓励活跃乐龄，甚至进一步延长退休年龄，让有意愿继续工作的年长者维持积极的心态。

伴随人口老龄化而不断增加的医疗需求和开支是大势所趋，负责任的做法是尽可能从源头减少需求。国人若普遍加强保健意识，维持健康的生活方式，既可降低个人的医疗保健消费成本，也有助于抑制国家在国民医疗方面的开支。这才是最基本的应变之策。",zaobao.com.sg,05-05-2022,"{'language': 'zh-cn', 'score': 0.9999984013741317}",zh-cn,0.9999984013741317

I was fully gowned up - there was no way for me to wipe my tears. I tried to distract myself with the tasks in the room. To hear but not to listen.

The patient was struggling to stay alive, the numbers on the monitors were blinking red, and the loved ones could only view through glass doors. 

I was told to do three video calls for my patient, one with each of his children. I had to be in the room, listening to their conversations. As the nurse, I had to do it. The call of duty. Each conversation was supposed to last 15 minutes. I had to do it three times.

And then the ECG flatlined. What do you tell the children? But somehow they knew.

The patient's wife arrived at the ward to see him. A scene that burned into my heart. A pair of lovebirds separated by the anteroom. She pleaded to let her enter the room, to at least be inside the anteroom. We declined. I explained why but those words - those were stabbing words.

It felt morally wrong to let an elder beg to see her love for the very last time, to exchange a final touch. But the stakes were too high. We had an obligation to the nation. It was for a greater good but at the expense of their grief. Protecting our people took precedence over their grief. An obligation we had to uphold, whether it was morally right or not.

All I could do was apologise. The word &quot;sorry&quot; could never describe the guilt I felt and could never fill the void in their grieving hearts.

With the medical social worker nodding his assent, I offered a final video call, to bridge this physical gap between the two doors. Maybe the family could have closure.

The patient's wife finally broke down and acknowledged his death, while I stood in the patient's room, holding the phone as close to his face as possible. Guilt ate into me but it had to be done this way. Do no harm.

Beneficence to our people. This was the call of duty.

Internal medicine resident Samuel Koh:

&quot;Hi doctor, there is a patient for admission.&quot;

When I walked in to see the patient, he was coughing vigorously. I reviewed the epidemiological history and found out that he was from Wuhan.

&quot;Did you go to the seafood market?&quot; I asked instinctively, as the infamous seafood market was already synonymous with the virus. He denied initially but continued shortly after I probed a second time: &quot;Actually, I visited the market with my son about three weeks ago.&quot;

The silence that ensued was deafening. Between the patient and myself, I suppose, we both had a gut feeling of what that meant.

There was plenty to do after that. Taking his swabs, keying in my findings, calling the infectious diseases consultant on call, and notifying the Ministry of Health (MOH) - all of which had to be done within one hour of his admission.

The patient's son was outside, gesticulating frantically and coughing - without a mask! He was eager to find out when the swab result would be ready. I handed him a mask and recalled asking, or probably berating, him to go to the emergency department. It was adrenaline that kept me going through the rest of the shift.

After my week of night float, the whole of ward 68 was full; uncertainty became the new normal.

Over the past 33 years, Ms Tan Geok Eng has accumulated a wealth of experience working with colleagues in disciplines as varied as IT, finance (for the Admitting Department), surgery and biomedical ethics. Though these are clearly diverse domains, Ms Tan has tapped on essentially the same capabilities to keep things running smoothly so that the staff at the frontline, the doctors and nurses, can do their job.

|CAMPAIGN SUMMARY|
Analiza, who has been an invaluable and faithful helper to Mr. Wong's family for the past 5 years, has been diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). It is a chronic, incurable autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the body because it confuses the body's organs for something foreign.
 
Analiza has suffered many damage and complications in many parts of her body, including kidney failure, low blood count, diminished brain and cognitive function, and difficulty breathing. Due to her many complications, she has been receiving treatments in the high dependency ward for the last month, and it is estimated to be longer than expected.
 
Analiza's employer, Mr. Wong, is in his 70s and is facing financial difficulties paying her hospital bills, as he has used much of his savings to pay off his late wife's medical bills. Mr. Wong is retiring in July, and his income is insufficient to cover Analiza's treatments as she is considered a foreigner and her bills are not subsidized.
 
We hope you can extend some assistance to the family for Analiza's medical bills. All funds raised will be paid directly to Singapore General Hospital.

Thank you 'Lynn' for sharing your story.

Thank you 'Lynn' for sharing your story.

&quot;Hi Syed, I just came across your page and I wanted to share an experience I had back in 2014. It is quite long so please bear with me on this one haha.

My sister and her husband used to live in Marymount at that time and I would occasionally travel to see her while he was away on business. At that time I took a part time job whilst at University and I would end late most of the time. On that particular night I ended around 8pm and I decided to stay over at my sisters instead of going back all the way home which was further. I took the train and then the circle line to Marymount. I decided to walk to her house which was just 15 minutes away. 

I remember being really tired from walking to her house. When I reached, my sister told me to take a shower and go to bed. We were supposed to be sleeping in the same room so I took a shower and went to bed.

Five minutes later she woke up breathing hard. She looked at me and immediately said that she had a nightmare. The way she looked at me like that gave me an uneasy feeling but I just brushed it off and I consoled her to go back to sleep. 

Fast forward a few days later I had a terrible fever which lasted the for almost 2 weeks. I had a bad cough which would kept me up all night and my fever was always on and off. I just figured it was because I was really tired from doing too many things at once. Once I recovered I went back to Uni and something unexpected happened. All of a sudden while walking my calves felt tight and my legs felt weird - I ignored it and went on with my day. I remember going to the Chinese Gardens in the evening for a stroll ( I was mentally tired and stressed and wanted to just sit and clear my mind before going home). 

That was the funny thing. I only sat down for around 15 minutes and I just dozed off. When I woke up I immediately got up and head for home as it was getting very dark. But..I couldn’t move! My legs would not move and pain was rushing through my calves. It felt like though someone had my feet were casted with a large cement blocks. It felt heavy and hurts terribly every single time I took a step.

 I was shocked over my condition. My lower limbs felt completely butchered. What would take a normal person to reach the MRT station from the garden took me at least 4 times longer. I limped very slowly all by myself and I made it to take a bus home from the bus stop near the MRT station . I called my mother and told her I couldn’t move and I was really scared. She told me she would wait for me at the bus stop.

She fetch me at the bus stop and took me to the clinic nearby. The doctor said that it's a possibility that I had Guillain Bare's Syndrome. It's a condition when a person’s own immune system harms their body’s nerves. This causes muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis.
I remember tearing up so bad while the ambulance took me to NUH. 

While I was waiting for a bed I dozed off and that’s when it happened. I don’t even know if it was a dream or if it was real life but there was a woman quatting on my hospital table rest. She had really messy wet hair and she was naked but deformed and covered in blood. She took a look at me and said “ you deserve this you really do” and then smiled at me and jumped from my rest and ran away. I woke up and started crying to myself. Because I was alone in the waiting room there was no one around and I was scared to death. I remember calling for my parents asking them if they could get to me out of there. Thankfully they managed to request to transferred to the Singapore General Hospital instead.

My ordeal continued from there. My lower limbs both and my arms were in a state of paralysis. I couldn’t move them and I couldn’t do anything on my own. I was only 19 at that time and the doctors couldn’t find what was really wrong with me. They used to take little tubes of blood to do some tests but ended up with nothing. Eventually they put me on tramadol medications and house rest for 4 months stating they didn’t know what was wrong with me. 

When I was home my dog would bark a lot which was something she never does. She would bark late at night and refuse to be in the same room with me. My parents started decluttering the house and prayed every single day. Thankfully my health was back to normal  5 months later. It was as if nothing had happened. But till now I don’t know what went wrong and what I did. I don’t know who that woman was and why she said that 'I deserved it'. Did my sister had a dream or premonition that something will happen to me? I’ll never forget what I had went through.&quot;

Mr.Zhenxin, who has been working in the construction industry in Singapore since 2007, came from China's Shandong province in search of a higher salary to send home. He suddenly became unwell a few weeks ago, continued to vomit, and was very weak. So he went to the emergency department of Singapore General Hospital on March 31, 2022, for treatment, and after some scans and tests, he was diagnosed with gastric cancer, stage 3. He had minor surgery and cannot eat any food because the malignant tumor (8cm) blocked the flow of food to his small intestine, causing malnutrition. His red blood cells dropped to half their normal levels. He has lost at least 10kg in the past two months, and he has received daily blood transfusions.

Unfortunately, his condition does not allow him to return to China for treatment. Most cities in China are locked down due to the new coronavirus, and Zhenxin has tested positive for COVID-19. He cannot get urgent care during the unknown coronavirus quarantine in China - Diagnosis and treatment. Doctors strongly advised him to stay in Singapore as it would take at least two months for his cancer cells to spread throughout his body after receiving cancer treatment in China. We have arranged for his wife to come to Singapore to take care of him, accompanied by his family, to overcome the disease. The doctor also suggested that Zhenxin needs eight chemotherapy and further major surgery to remove the cancerous part. He only has 15,000 Singapore dollars in insurance money and some donations from colleagues. Still, it is not enough to cover his high medical expenses, so we hope to seek the help of good-hearted people and give Zhenxin a chance to restore his health and hope for survival. All the funds raised will be paid directly to the hospital to pay for Zhenxin's medical expenses, which can help those in need around him to tide over the difficulties. I would also like to thank my friends in Singapore for their enthusiastic delivery.​

The key is that it is difficult to return to the country due to the impact of the new crown epidemic and its challenging to cure. He has domestic medical insurance in China, but his condition can not delay the outbreak and can only be treated in Singapore. I hope the friendship and family of kind people can help him. Conquer the disease.
Thank you very much for your kindness and support. 
Good people live in peace!

From 5 February to 18 March 2020, 446 patients fulfilled MOH’s criteria for a suspect case and were admitted to our Isolation Wards – 15 of these tested positive for the novel virus. During the same period, 1,178 patients were admitted to ARI wards – five were tested positive. Although the yield appeared low, SGH stalwarts (SARS veterans in particular) recognised the positive impact of the ARI wards. We had prevented five clusters from forming in Singapore.

Norashikin is a Principal Enrolled Nurse at the Cardiac Clinics at National Heart Centre Singapore. Her passion in nursing has influenced and inspired her son greatly over the years. As a young boy, Amirul often tagged along to Norashikin’s work events. Even while she was revising her Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) course, an essential training that equips healthcare professionals with Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) knowledge and skills, Norashikin would take the opportunity to teach CPR to her then-young son. All these rubbed off on Amirul whom had decided at a young age that he would follow his mother’s footsteps to become a nurse. He benefitted from his mother’s guidance and knowledge while pursuing his diploma in nursing, and is now a Staff Nurse with Singapore General Hospital.

“I was so surprised when he first told me he is going to join nursing as nursing is a female-dominated profession. But now, I feel so proud of him,” beamed Norashikin.
 
During Mother’s Day last year when the pandemic was at its peak, Norashikin and Amirul were in the midst of their deployment to high risk Covid-19 areas. To minimise risk of contact, they could not meet physically to celebrate the occasion. However, Norashikin received a sweet message from Amirul, a simple gesture which warmed her heart and motivated her to press on with caring for high-risk patients. 
 
This year, with the easing of restrictions, our mother and son nursing duo hopes to meet up for a proper celebration on Mother’s Day if they are not on work duty. In addition, Norashikin’s family understand how hard she has worked over the past two years during this pandemic and will be whisking her away for a well-deserved holiday!

Dubbed the Artemis Touch, C1 and C2 Artemisians painted Hunter :wolf:and SAM :teddy_bear:, two icons that are emblematic of the Artemis Faculty and SGH respectively, as they left their personal mark through their fingerprints.

★行为策略：
·暂停
当你愤怒时，暂时走开，给自己空间安静下来，远离让你不安的特定情况或人，或深呼吸，默数到十，以化解怒气。
·身体锻炼
锻炼是释放压力和挫折感的好方法。快步走、做瑜伽、慢跑或长跑、游泳、去健身房、做运动、足球、网球或篮球都有助管理愤怒。锻炼不仅为情绪提供出口，也让身体产生让人放松平静的内啡肽。
·膈肌深呼吸或冥想
情绪爆发时多放松，利用缓慢的深呼吸，感觉横膈膜随着吸气而扩张，随着呼气而收缩。想象你在一个放松的场景或以前去过的平静地方，让自己平静下来。另，通过冥想，学习安静，有助提高注意力、意识和能量。

情绪爆发时多放松，利用缓慢的深呼吸，感觉横膈膜随着吸气而扩张，随着呼气而收缩。想象你在一个放松的场景或以前去过的平静地方，让自己平静下来。另，通过冥想，学习安静，有助提高注意力、意识和能量。
贝克说，其他缓解愤怒方法包括：听音乐、跳舞、听音乐会、找朋友叙旧等。当愤怒失控对个人生活、人际关系与他人生活产生负面影响，就应向心理健康专家求助。

Traditionally, IBD was regarded as a disease of the western world. Newer epidemiological studies suggest that, with the turn of the 21st century, IBD has become a global disease with rising incidence in newly industrialised countries in Asia, Africa, and South America. There are also advances in the diagnostics and therapeutic armamentarium of IBD. In this webinar, we will share with you what IBD is, what are the tests to perform to diagnose IBD and the treatment options. https://www.facebook.com/SingaporeGeneralHospital/videos/1014198629524508/",facebook.com,02-04-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999964204709534}",en,0.9999964204709534

1029,中央医院接受保留膝盖手术患者 一年内翻倍 - 8world,"在新加坡中央医院接受保留膝盖手术的膝关节炎患者在一年内增加了约一倍。

中央医院的医生去年进行了大约100名病人进行保留膝关节的手术，比前年的近50人多，而在今年头三个月，就有大约30人接受了手术。

保留膝盖的手术适合年龄介于40到60岁的患者。这类手术不但可以解决膝关节炎的问题，同时也能延缓甚至避免患者在未来需要进行更换膝关节的手术。

目前，有两种保留膝盖的手术较为普遍，一种是改良版的高位胫骨截骨术HTO，另一种是腓骨近端截骨术PFO。

中央医院骨科运动医学服务兼保膝服务组长李洸辉顾问医生介绍两种手术的不同之处。

李洸辉说：“第一个就是把臀部和小腿调直，里头会放一块骨头，还有需要放一块铁片进去固定住膝盖，如果病人的身体不能接受那个铁片，例如皮肤不好，或者有糖尿病，我们就做另一种手术，就是在小腿的外侧拿掉两公分的小骨，也是能减少膝盖内侧的疼痛。85%的病人还是蛮满意的，让我们有信心可以继续让病人接受这些手术。”

李医生说，在上世纪7、80年代就已经有高位胫骨截骨术，但他从2019年起改良手术的做法，在患者膝盖内加入一块骨头，再使用较小的钛板加以固定。患者在进行改良版的手术后，康复期减半到两、三个月。

至于第二种手术在大约五年前才面世。67岁的刘升泰是本地首位进行这类手术的患者。他在前年10月动手术，留医一晚后就出院休养。

Fire at Bukit Merah flat linked to battery pack of electric bike

quoted
Five people were taken to hospital after a &quot;raging&quot; fire broke out in an HDB flat in Bukit Merah on Wednesday (Mar 30), the Singapore Civil Defence Force said.
SCDF responded to the fire on the second floor of Block 121, Bukit Merah View about 11.45am, it said in a Facebook post.

When emergency responders arrived, the fire was already raging in a space that served as both the living room and a bedroom in the one-room flat.
SCDF said that firefighters had to don breathing apparatus sets and manoeuvre their way into the &quot;heavily smoky unit&quot;.
The fire was extinguished using a water jet.
Two people from the affected unit had evacuated prior to the arrival of SCDF, while 35 others from the block were subsequently evacuated.
One resident sustained burn injuries while another four people had smoke inhalation. They were taken to Singapore General Hospital, said SCDF.

She’d applied for a posting in Pathology after her applications to Paediatrics, Dermatology and Anaesthesia were rejected. With Pathology too, she wasn’t successful.

So, no strong deterrent message to “would be” assaulters/abusers.

An example:

Look at the chau ang mor who assaulted the security supervisor at Roxy Square UNPROVOKED.   He was given one- week jailterm ONLY. The assaulter was caught on CCTV.   Of course, he used alcohol as the reason.  If that’s the case, why didn’t he assault his wife or other family members when he got home or assault his drinking partners?  He was still knowing cognitively.    

Only one week - a slap on his wrist.   Of course, more assaults will perpetuate.  Use someone as a punching bag, let out one’s frustration or teach someone a “lesson”,  one week jailterm ….pretty worth it!  So after drinking, those half high ones can go smashing others??

There are also cases of assault on our police, similarly, not enough of a deterrent sentence was meted out each time.

起诉人张思云（44岁）与答辩人陈恒宁（Chan Herng Nieng）曾有过外遇，如今已分手。陈恒宁原是当时在新加坡中央医院担任精神科医学高级顾问医生。

起诉人表示，她与陈恒宁交往约一年半，陈恒宁期间开了赞安诺（Xanax）以及曲唑酮（Trazodone）等镇静剂给她应付焦虑问题。

起诉人称，陈恒宁以个人名义开药给自己，然后再转交给她服用，没有将她登记在医院病人记录里。

为证明自己说的是实话，起诉人表示自己有与陈恒宁之间的简讯内容，显示陈恒宁早在2017年1月20日便开始提供镇静剂给她，为期11个月。

起诉人也指陈恒宁没有做治疗笔记，在两人分手后还断了她的药源，甚至没有将她转介给其他医生。

起诉人表示，陈恒宁虽没把她登记为病人，但有给她吃镇静剂，因此她也算是陈恒宁的病人。

起诉人称自己吃药吃上瘾，事后还出现口齿不清、易怒、认知困难等副作用，需要进行精神治疗以及辅导。

起诉人指陈恒宁的种种行为违反了医生对病人该有的义务，因此起诉对方疏忽，要求赔偿。

据了解，起诉人要求约18万元的赔偿。

The breadth and diversity of Dr Tan’s professional engagements suggests someone who is able to lead several lives with the resources of one body. Dr Tan’s introspection come across not only in his air of unshakeable purpose, but also in his reminiscences about the events that led to his choice of career, his passion for philanthropy and other key decisions.

1190,总理：国人信任政府和医疗体系 为我国抗疫关键因素 - 8world,"总理李显龙认为，国人对政府和医疗体系的高度信任，是协助我国应对冠病最关键的因素。

李总理今天（24日）在新加坡中央医院主办的一场晚宴上发表演讲时说，我国多年来已经在社会上建立高度信任，让国人在疫情期间能够团结一致，而不是相互对抗。

他举例，国人履行个人和社会责任，遵守安全管理措施、耐心地接受反复收紧和放宽的防疫措施，以及接种冠病疫苗和追加剂，都能显示民众信任政府；相反的，在其他国家，像戴口罩这样简单且必要的预防措施，则会引发公众之间的激烈争论。

对此，李总理认为，很大原因是公众对我国医疗系统有信心、相信医护人员的专业，并且相信医疗系统会以公开和诚实的态度面对公众，即便是当事情不如预期，或者在执行过程出现错误时。

他表示，有些人可能会认为，保持沉默和避免发布坏消息引起不必要的恐慌，是应对疫情更容易的做法。但是，这不仅非常不明智，还会导致谣言传播，使得公众逐渐对医疗系统失去信心。

感谢医护人员高压下抗疫 

李总理还说，医护人员在疫情期间面对非常大的工作压力，而当局已经尽力给他们一些喘息的机会，让他们有足够的休息时间来充电。

“这两年对他们来说是非常具有挑战性的，这样的运作在正常情况下显然是不可持续的。”

有鉴于此，李总理再次感谢医护人员的贡献，并且呼吁各机构和社区继续关注他们的福利和健康，好让他们继续为所有人付出。 ...",8world.com,24-04-2022,"{'language': 'zh-cn', 'score': 0.999998171375414}",zh-cn,0.999998171375414

然而，他也表示，未来几十年内，全球有可能出现另一种比冠病更具传染性和致命性的新型病原体，因此我国必须充分利用危机所作出的改变，改进办事方式，认真准备应对下一次疫情。

这意味着，我国必须投资在良好的医疗设施和医护人员，以保持卓越的医疗标准。

李总理也指出，我国将转向发展公共卫生专业知识，以更好地了解一种新疾病是如何传播，并制定非医疗措施，以帮助遏制疫情。

As a breast surgical oncologist, I perform oncoplastic breast surgery to restore the aesthetic form of patients’ breasts after tumour removal. My work is particularly fulfilling as it demands surgical excellence and technical creativity to provide the best surgical solution for patients. Imparting these skills and ensuring breast surgeons are well-versed in oncoplastic breast surgery gives me great joy and fulfilment.

It motivates me to know that my work matters to patients. We have established programmes to deliver comprehensive care for young women with breast cancer. The positive impact motivates me to search for new ways to transform breast cancer care.

At the height of the pandemic, we were shorthanded in the operating theatres. Manpower was reassigned for COVID-19 needs. SGH’s Major Operating Theatre nursing team and I then developed a programme that trains enrolled nurses as surgical assistants. The nurses learnt about the different types of surgeries, and gained skills in surgical scrubbing and hands-on assisting techniques for breast cancer surgery. To date, more than 20 enrolled nurses have been trained and assisted in more than 250 surgeries.

Thanks to this cross-disciplinary initiative, surgeries could be performed in a timely manner. The nurses also benefitted from the upskilling of their capabilities with higher job satisfaction.

I am also passionate about improving breast health literacy, and work closely with Health Promotion Board, Singapore, Singapore Cancer Society and Breast Cancer Foundation to educate women on reducing breast cancer risks by going for regular screening. My team and I are now working with HPB and Ministry of Health, Singapore to improve health literacy among the younger generation in schools.

I look forward to a future where the incidence of breast cancer in Singapore is decreased, and where patients are diagnosed at an early, curable stage and live well after cancer.",facebook.com,01-03-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.999997180954775}",en,0.999997180954775

1222,年科研经费达56亿元，新加坡中央医院如何实现“集团式创新”？,"文 |动脉橙果局

2015年，“新加坡国父”李光耀感染严重肺炎，被送入新加坡中央医院（Singapore General Hospital，简称SGH）接受治疗，并在那里度过了他生命的最后一段光阴。事实上，新加坡中央医院还是新加坡前任总理纳丹以及现任总理李显龙的指定诊疗医院。

这当然不是一般医疗机构能享受到的“待遇”，能成为连续三届领导人的“御用医院”，新加坡中央医院必定是有“过人之处”。

首先从资历来看，新加坡中央医院绝对称得上是“元老”级别，始建于1821年的它，甚至比新加坡还早成立了近一个世纪。

其次从声望来看，新加坡中央医院是亚洲排名第一的医疗机构，并常年位居全球医疗机构排行榜前十。

然后从体量来看，新加坡中央医院是新加坡规模最大的医疗机构，现聘有1万多名职工，设有包括移植手术、肾脏医学、核医学等在内的29种医学专科，每年接待超过100万名患者，承担了新加坡三分之一以上的用药需求。

最后从科研来看，新加坡中央医院所拥有实验室是美国病理学院（CAP）认证的东南亚最大、最全面、最综合的实验室，也是东南亚唯一一家拥有多学科癌症研究中心的医疗机构。另外在经费支出上，据数据统计，其年度科研经费已超过12亿新币，折合人民币约56亿元。

其实，两百年前诞生于新加坡河附近一个棚屋里的新加坡中央医院，最初只是迫于战时兵营医疗资源的短缺而成立，甚至在二十世纪，一度因为医疗人员短缺和疟疾而面临倒闭的困境。之所以能一直走到现在，与新加坡中央医院专注医疗创新和转化有很大关系，它就像是一股源源不断的推动力，不断指引新加坡中央医院朝更好的方向前进。

刻进医院DNA里的创新孵化体系

历经两个世纪，新加坡中央医院在新加坡这片风云变幻的土地上始终勒紧缰绳，不断寻找新的方向以突破困境，逐渐形成了以“服务、科研、教育”为核心驱动力的医疗创新和转化体系。

首先是服务，也就是临床上，新加坡中央医院始终秉承“以人为本”，坚持提供可担负且优质的护理服务。

本地专家为此开发筛查症状的问卷，让女性从中了解自己是否有患子宫内膜异位症的风险。

39岁的义顺集选区议员陈浍敏从十几岁起就一直忍受着剧烈的经痛。她曾因痛经而昏倒，被送进急诊室。直到27岁在切除卵巢囊肿手术中，医生才发现她有子宫内膜异位症。

陈浍敏说：“我以前也以为妇女来月经经痛时正常的。其实一点也不正常，可能有一些潜在的情况必须去注意。希望大家可以尽早跟医生了解，也积极地叫医生多注意。”

国立大学医院妇产科部门顾问医生马丽说，女性平均延误的诊断时间是7到10年。因为很多医生认为经痛只需开止痛药，或扫描看到没有卵巢囊肿，就告诉病人他们没有子宫内膜异位症。这其实是很大的误区，也是导致治疗延误的主要原因。

马丽说：“对于家庭医生和专科医生，我们发展了一些专门治疗常规，用来指导医生怎么早期诊断内膜异位症，怎么早期治疗内膜异位症。”

子宫内膜异位症常见的症状包括严重的痛经和月经相关的腹泻等，也会因此影响病人的生育能力。

1257,疫情期间生活作息改变 饮食失调症患者增三成 - 8world,"疫情期间生活作息改变，导致患有饮食失调症的人增加。新加坡中央医院的数据显示，求诊人数去年达到近230个，同比增加超过三成。今年首两个月继续呈上升趋势。慈善机构关爱之家也发现过去这一年来这类辅导需求翻了三倍。他们已设立专家小组专门辅导这些病患。

疫情期间长时间在家，容易和家人产生摩擦，有的人甚至觉得自己的一举一动被家人无时无刻监视而感到焦虑，于是开始靠暴饮暴食发泄情绪。

中央医院表示去年近230人因饮食失调而寻求治疗，比前一年的170人多了约35%，其中神经性贪食症占多数。受访医生认为病例增加，有可能是因为疫情期间国人熟悉的舒压方式受到了约束。

新加坡中央医院饮食失调组组长、精神科医学高级顾问医生吴嘉玮说：“像有一些人他们就在那个时候开始产生一些比较不良的应对技巧，例如说用食物来发泄、暴饮暴食。这样他们对自己的体型也开始比较注意，就可能也是会比较极端、过度运动，开始慢慢地产生饮食失调症。”

关爱之家去年辅导的饮食失调个案增加到28个。相较2019和2020年，这两年加起来的个案不到十个。组织说求助的人大部分年龄介于18到30岁。

关爱之家执行总监谭润娴说：“通常上瘾以前比较多是偏向于毒品、酒瘾。然后饮食失调症是近几年就比较开始有那个现象。所以我们现在至少有两个至三个辅导员就是专注于这方面。”

神经性厌食症也是另一个关注点。中央医院表示月底将举办免费线上讲座，提高国人对饮食失调症的认识。 ...",8world.com,05-03-2022,"{'language': 'zh-cn', 'score': 0.9999980934310351}",zh-cn,0.9999980934310351

The COVID-19 situation has introduced greater unknowns and uncertainties into our daily lives, many Singaporeans are feeling anxious and stressed from having to cope with changes to our everyday life. The COVID-19 situation will continue to pose a challenge to our mental well-being and health.

As such, today we are glad to have a Mental Well-Being Dialogue to learn more about what we can do as an individual and as a community, to support one another and the seniors at Kolam Ayer for better mental well-being.

My coping mechanism is talking to my family members and listen to their daily ramblings. If you need additional resources and tips on self-care and supporting others, you may visit MindSG.gov.sg for more information. Let’s also look out for our families and friends, keep an open mind, listen empathetically and encourage them to seek help early. It starts with us!

Special thanks to Ms Sherylene Heah (Principal Medical Social Worker Singapore General Hospital) and Ms Joanne Koh (Assistant Director, Mental Health Education Department of HPB) for joining me in the Mental Well-Being Dialogue @ Kolam Ayer.

I accompanied my relative for a colonoscopy.
I would like to provide feedback about the treatment and attitude of your healthcare staff.

Firstly, the staff told us that we are unable to use the washroom as they are meant for patients’ use. That is despite me witnessing another senior citizen in some urgency to use the washroom. There should be more flexibility and room for exceptional cases especially when senior citizens are involved. I also witnessed another healthcare staff using the washroom claimed to be for patients’ use. This is a form of double standard. 

Secondly, as my relative does not understand English and all the available staff I saw were non-Chinese hence I stayed a while more to ensure all is well however I was being told to leave before I could even settle my relative properly. There should again be flexibility as I am not crowding the area nor am I staying beyond the period that I should be there. Since the rules dictate that one accompanying person is allowed then I should not be restricted to stay until I have settled my relative properly and taken over her belongings.

Thirdly, may I check what is the point of installing the lockers when they are not allowed to be used by patients? I was told to hold on to my relative’s bags while she will only be holding on to her clothes. If a patient does not have a caregiver accompanying, may I check whom will oversee the storage of their belongings?

Fourthly, the hot water lever of water dispenser is not working so facilities management staff need to rectify it.

Fifthly, the banner of ordering medications to be delivered home is only in English so may I check how are the senior citizens able to use this function? 
There was a nurse who simply directed an old man to the banner without explaining how it could be done or further assistance. What happened to the slogan of “Patients. At the heart of all we do.”?

Sixthly, the auto flushing sensor of the patient washroom is faulty and with this pandemic, there should be more emphasis on motion sensors.

Lastly, the direction to the discharge lounge isn’t clear and caregivers may miss it.

There ought to be flexibility and compassion in the healthcare line. 
Such inflexibility does not benefit the patients at all. 
Having one caregiver accompanying the patient also provides a form of emotional support and we are all trying to promote better mental welfare so I sincerely hope Singapore General Hospital will also do its part. 
No healthcare professional can beat one’s loved one by their side and this is basic. 

It’s ironic to have posters of how healthcare workers should not be abused yet the MOs are so overworked under the current healthcare system.

The Division of Radiological Sciences (RADSC) at the SGH comprises 700 staff members from four departments. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, each department managed its infection prevention (IP) activities autonomously, focusing on awareness, education and compliance.

At the onset of the pandemic, the division pivoted from autonomous department-level units to an integrated, division-level RADSC Disease Outbreak Taskforce (RDOTF) Infection, Prevention & Epidemiology (IPE) Response Team that could anticipate, adapt and respond to the rapidly evolving situation, and ensure that the relevant IP measures were adequate in protecting our staff and patients.

Comprising radiologists, radiographers, nurses and patient service staff, the RDOTF IPE Response Team worked together to overcome the many challenges presented by the pandemic, such as having to navigate guidelines that were constantly changing.

On a daily (and eventually weekly) basis, we reviewed and worked through issues ranging from workload and equipment to manpower deployment and walkabout audits.

Amidst this, we were also able to come up with several innovative solutions, including the SG.SAFE.R booth within the Ward@Bowyer where patients with COVID-19 were warded. The booth isolates patients undergoing chest x-ray imaging from the equipment and staff to allow for safer operations, faster disinfection and a quicker turnaround time. Another innovation is the “COVID Travel Lane” to convey patients for CT imaging, which mitigates contamination risk and reduces wait time for urgent COVID-19 cases.

These improvements and new solutions mitigated the risk of viral transmission. Staff confidence was boosted in a safer work  environment and we could deliver imaging without compromising patient care.

We are heartened that our efforts have prevented cross-infection among the staff and patients during the pandemic. #SHQSA",facebook.com,08-03-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999972582027998}",en,0.9999972582027998

At approximately 1.15pm today (9 Mar), SCDF responded to a fire at the above-mentioned location. 

The fire involved the contents of a living room in a fourth floor unit. Upon SCDF's arrival, the fire was raging and one of the unit occupants, who had self-evacuated with a baby, informed the firefighters that there were still people in the burning unit.

A few firefighters swiftly made their way into the burning unit and rescued three unconscious persons from a room while other firefighters battled the fire to prevent it from spreading.

The fire was extinguished with one water jet.

One of the occupants who was rescued was not breathing and SCDF Emergency Medical Services personnel immediately conducted Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) on her. She was conveyed to Changi General Hospital.

SCDF conveyed a total of four persons to Changi General Hospital and Singapore General Hospital. Among them was a resident from a neighbouring unit who had suffered burn injuries on her shoulder as she was self-evacuating prior to SCDF’s arrival.

About 50 residents were evacuated by the police as a precautionary measure.

Preliminary investigation into the cause of the fire indicates that it was of electrical origin from a Personal Mobility Device (PMD) which was charging in the living room at the time of the fire. There were also two other Power Assisted Bicycles (PABs), one was found in the unit and another was placed outside the unit.

SCDF would like to remind the public on the prevention of PMD fires with the following fire safety tips in the accompanying infographic.

Non-UL2272 PMDs and any form of modifications to PMDs pose a fire risk and threaten public safety. Owners of these devices are strongly encouraged to dispose of their devices at the appropriate recyclers. More details: http://go.gov.sg/amrules

Of the 25 who were infected, 20 were kidney transplant patients. Eight of them died.

It was the worst crisis Dr Terence Kee Yi Shern had faced in all his years of practising Medicine.

The brows of the mild-mannered physician knitted as he looked back on that trying period:
‘It was a life-changing event and I was in the thick of it. The feeling was like being a commander looking after this team of soldiers and the soldiers are all dying, one by one, in the battle. As a doctor, you never want to lose any patients, but to lose so many within a short period of time, it was devastating.

The Parsi community in Singapore may be small, but they have made big contributions to enhancing and enriching the fabric of our society in Singapore.

Amongst some of the well known contributions : the Mistri Wing of the Singapore General Hospital and Mistri Road in Tanjong Pagar are named in recognition of the philanthropic contributions by the late Mr. Navroji Mistri, a well known Parsi in Singapore.  

There is also a Parsi story behind the well loved department store John Little’s (shows a bit of my vintage that I used to enjoy visiting this store!).

I was honoured to have inaugurated the new Joyous Flame Museum, at Zoroastrian House today. Members of the Inter-Religious Organisation, Singapore were present, standing proudly with our Zoroastrian friends at the inauguration. The Museum hosts a well curated collection of Zoroastrian artefacts and historical records.
 
It is also a living reminder of how intertwined Singapore’s early beginnings are with the local Parsi Zoroastrian community, a reflection of how Singapore’s shared history and heritage is truly ethnically and culturally diverse.

The Parsi community has since been giving back to Singapore, exemplifying the Zoroastrian principles of Humata, Hukta, Huvarshta (Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds).
 
Congratulations to the Parsi Zoroastrian Association of Southeast Asia (PZAS) and the Parsi Zoroastrian community on The Joyous Flame Museum! :fire:

1385,病患可通过应用查看电子药单药量 中央医院改善并简化药物订购服务,"​

中央医院简化了药物订购服务，用户从去年8月起无须上载药单，并能随时随地通过应用获取电子药单，直接订药。改善后的应用也会显示病患之前已订购和目前可取的药量，让病患选择补充哪些药物和剂量。

新加坡中央医院改善并简化药物订购服务，病患可通过手机应用查看可订购的处方药量，并要求药物递送服务。

中央医院自2018年推出药物订购服务并豁免运送费，主要方便病患通过HealthHub或HealthBuddy应用订药，并安排药物递送到家里或附近的药局等地点领取。

但病患每次订药，都得亲自把药单上载至应用，常出现处方丢失等问题。另外，每10名病患当中，就有两三人会忘记自己已从处方中领取的药量，直到剩下最后剂量，才发现可订购的药量不足以撑到下一次复诊，等待医生批准的新处方。

中央医院高级首席临床药剂师曾洁盈受访时解释：“有时病患发现家里药物不足，就会擅自减少剂量，因而造成病情恶化，如血压或血糖上升、痛风发作等问题。严重的话，还可能得住院治疗。”

如今中央医院简化了药物订购服务，用户从去年8月起无须上载药单，并能随时随地通过应用获取电子药单，直接订药。改善后的应用也会显示病患之前已订购和目前可取的药量，让病患选择补充哪些药物和剂量。

医院鼓励病患提前一周订药，递送时间约三四个工作日。病患也能在订购时填写特别指示，比如要求中文的用药说明。

预计可惠及逾17万名病患
药物订购服务每月可接到七八千个要求，新版本预计可惠及超过17万名病患，让他们看诊后无须到中央医院的药房等待取药。

中央医院高级首席药剂师林晶慧透露，药物订购服务将逐步推行到其他新保集团旗下的机构，几家新保集团综合诊疗所计划下个月使用平台。

胡如豪（55岁，信息技术顾问）的84岁父亲目前须服用约10种处方药来控制多种慢性病。多年来，他几乎每月都会陪父亲看诊或取药。

由于胡如豪不与父母同住，他难以监控父亲的用药频率，只能每次订购三个月的药量，确保父亲定时用药。

他说：“我们以前拿药须亲自到药房等待近一个小时，如今我以看护者的身份为父亲订药，直接送到他家。”

他希望手机应用能显示药物的非专业名称，或在药名旁显示药物模样，让用户更易识别不同的处方药。

1386,私人飞机师醉酒闹事　辱骂踢伤警员判监10周,"一名澳洲籍私人飞机师酒后闹事，惊动警方到场后，不仅出言辱骂警员，还踢伤警员的脸。

被告卡梅隆（40岁）昨日被判监禁10周，罚款5000新元（约1万5000令吉）。他承认3项罪名，包括蓄意伤害公务员、骚扰公务员以及酒后闹事。另有5项控状在判刑时一并纳入考量。

根据《今日报》报道，2018年6月4日晚上，被告与几个朋友约在驳船码头喝酒，然后再到泛太平洋酒店的一家酒吧，与朋友们喝两大瓶伏特加。凌晨1时30分左右，被告离开酒吧前往滨海广场的一家便利店买水。

当时有一群工人正在进行国庆庆典电缆工程的安装。一名工人看到被告在罗里上乱扔器材，并拒绝从罗里下车。有工人注意到，被告身上有强烈的酒味，而且“跌跌撞撞，说话语无伦次”，于是决定报警，因为被告干扰了他们的工作。

在等待警方到来当儿，被告试图逃跑，工人们就向附近看护安装工程工作的国民服役人员求助。被告在挣扎中，拉着一名服役人员一起跌入灌木丛中，过程中他还撕破了后者的衣服。

警方到场后，针对警员的询问，被告无法完整给出详细的资料和地址，警方便以在公共场合醉酒闹事的罪名逮捕被告。

然而，被告坐上警车后，开始大喊大叫，并到处乱踢，包括踢前排座椅的后背，他还反复踢坐在后座的警员。

被踢中的警员嘉玛鲁中士，过后到新加坡中央医院就医，经检查发现他的脸部有肿胀、轻微触痛，脸上还有长宽各约5厘米的瘀伤。

法庭文件列出被告在后座针对警员抛出的九句露骨辱骂字眼。这些都被警员随身携带的摄像机拍下。

副检察官童丽华（译音）要求法庭以蓄意伤害阻差办公的罪名，判处被告10至12周监禁。

她也要求在防止骚扰法令下，再判处被告两周监禁，并对酒后在公共场所的骚扰行为加判短期监视。

被告辩护律师阿南求情时说，这是一起酒精影响下的孤立事件，而且非常不符合被告的性格，也是被告在新加坡居住的几年中，唯一一次触犯法律行为。

“被告在事发不久观看了录像视频，明显感到羞愧，并毫无保留地向警方人员道歉。”

对此，检察官表示，喝醉酒失控不能作为求情借口，因此不应给予其减刑。

法官宣判时表示，他考虑到被告在事发前没有犯罪记录，并且有悔意，并将辩方提交的品行证明考虑在内，因此以辱骂警员的罪名判监10周，并对被告抵触防止骚扰法令和酒后在公共场所闹事的罪名分别判处4000新元（约1万2000令吉）和1000新元（约3000令吉）的罚款。 ...",shicheng.news,19-03-2022,"{'language': 'zh-cn', 'score': 0.8571405922216048}",zh-cn,0.8571405922216048

病患可上网查阅健康记录订药

新加坡中央医院提升在线平台的服务，让病患从线上查阅健康记录和订购药物。新保集团旗下的其他医疗机构预计在未来几年也将推出同样的服务。

病患现在可通过保健资讯网应用程序和Health Buddy手机应用查看自己的药物记录，通过线上订购所需的药物，让院方把药物递送到家。

新加坡中央医院高级首席临床药剂师曾洁盈表示：“时候病人可能会临时发觉家里的药物不足，又没有能马上补充他们的药物，所以我们发现他们会擅自减少剂量，因而造成病情控制恶化。严重的话可能导致需要住院治疗。”

当局将部署数码大使在医疗机构和社区协助一些不会使用线上服务的病患。预计超过17万名病患将从这项服务受益。

《海峡时报》昨天的一篇报道，就活生生地反映了上述情况。

73岁的陈女士（假名）因便秘了好几个星期，即使吃泻药也没效，后来更是出现便血，2021年1月到综合诊疗所看医生。

医生担心她可能罹患结肠癌，让她接受结肠镜检查来加以确定。

陈女士被转介到新加坡中央医院看专科医生。

由于政府医院当时为了应对疫情忙得不可开交，为了确保医院床位充足有能力应付冠病确诊病例增加的突发情况，所有非紧急病患的手术都被推迟了好几次，所有非紧急的医疗程序，包括各种检查，也只能往后排期。

结肠镜检查属于日间手术，将内窥镜插入直肠和大肠，检查息肉和其他癌症迹象。属于“非紧急”范畴的结肠镜检查的预约，于是乎就必须等上五个月，也就是要到去年6月才能进行。
新加坡中央医院。（海峡时报）
我国卫生部医药服务总监麦锡威副教授在最近的记者会上曾表示，由于要处理积压的非冠病患者手术，政府医院依然面临资源吃紧的问题。

他说，这“反映了我们在过去几个月所欠下的债务”，医院会把重点重新放在治疗这些患者。

由于害怕罹患癌症，陈女士不想等待，于是求助于伊丽莎白诺维娜的肠胃及肝胆专科顾问医生韦俊韬。她在去年2月3日求诊后，一周内就完成了结肠镜检查。

她最担心的事发生了，她不仅罹患结肠癌，而且病情还相当严重，已经扩散到肝脏。

韦医生建议她带着检查结果回去综合诊疗所，再转介到政府医院接受资助治疗。

他向陈女士保证，其他被他送回政府医院的癌症患者都能得到优先考虑，并在两周内接受治疗。

伤者的女友刘小姐向《8视界新闻网》说，从事金融业工作的30岁男友蔡先生，上星期天（20日）晚上在马真路（Merchant Road）一带被人从背后袭击。

她说，男友当晚和朋友一起庆生，到一家店用餐后，大约在10点半想要去路旁的便利店买饮料，没想到半途遭人从背后袭击。

“他没有看到是谁，也不记得有没有转过身看。因为事情太突然，之后发生什么，他就有点记不得了。”

刘小姐表示，男友虽然流了很多血，之后还能走一到两分钟，回去向朋友求助。

His interest in Paediatrics led to his specialisation in Neonatology, the medical care of newborn infants. He was the founding head of Neonatology at SGH when it was set up in 1986. The department was the first in Singapore to have an ultrasound machine to study newborn babies’ brains.

The #supercomputer is expected to process large and complex data sets to make sense of diseases and escalate it. Where standard computers might take days to train the Artificial Intelligence (AI) using a set of patient data, the #supercomputer could do it in hours. This will significantly speed up healthcare research.

The software tools and AI models are provided by American chipmaker, NVIDIA, under an agreement signed together with National Supercomputing Centre Singapore - NSCC and SingHealth. Learn more about the new supercomputer sited in Singapore General Hospital, and the plans we have to train AI systems for better patient care.

SGH is currently working with GovTech (Government Technology Agency of Singapore), Agency for Integrated Care - AIC Singapore and SingHealth Regional Health System on Project Pensieve to develop a new a digital drawing test that may be used for estimating one’s risk of dementia in just 10 minutes. It does so by using artificial intelligence to analyse how seniors draw certain shapes and symbols.
 
As part of the Project, the team will invite 1,000 seniors living in the Hospital vicinity to undergo a test to assess if they have dementia. If the seniors are found to have dementia, they will be referred to SGH’s Memory Clinic for further care, and AIC will also reach out to them to discuss about referrals to community services.
 
The tool is expected to be ready for wider community use, after 2024.

If the PSA at the ED would have been more clearer on what she meant in terms of isolation, I would not have chosen to be &quot;isolated&quot; with 4/5 patients in a room within a ward. Now it's endless wait for a single isolation room. As much as the MOH or SGH can claim the ward/room is still considered isolation, I do not accept this logic of being isolated with others together, sharing one bathroom. Yes, one can claim it's the living-with-COVID strategy. Guess what? We are in midst of another wave now! 

Worst, this happened on CNY Eve, when I had reunion lunch with my old folks, then warded on the same date by nightfall. The ED staff nurses seem unable to understand that I was extremely worried for my old folks (we'd already know COVID19 affects more of the elderlies), and blatantly ignorant of my concerns. Yes, I'd get that ED's priority was to treat me first, but at least acknowledge the fact that I'm deeply worried for my old folks! Suffice to say, some of the staffs brushed these concerns off and couldn't be bothered. By the way, that CNY Eve night at SGH, I'd observed that it's not that busy either. As much as you want to treat patients' conditions first, at least acknowledge our worries!

It was only until the attending emergency physician decided to contact my old folks, then my concerns were properly addressed.

1523,SGH building housed secret Japanese lab for biological warfare during WW2 Bubonic-plague-carrying fleas ...,"SGH building housed secret Japanese lab for biological warfare during WW2 Bubonic-plague-carrying fleas were bred there.

Tanya Ong |  November 14, 2017, 10:07 AM

In 1940, Japan's military used biological warfare in its invasion of China. China was &quot;bombed&quot; with bubonic-plague-carrying fleas.

According to The Straits Times, records show that the bubonic plague killed 3,031 people in China's Jilin province in June 1940, and 9,060 people in Zhejiang province in October that same year.

The unit that was in charge of biowarfare was the infamous Japanese Unit 731, and one of its bases was in Singapore. During the Japanese Occupation, the medical unit attached to the Japanese Army in Singapore was called OKA 9420.

OKA 9420's role involved the prevention of water-borne diseases, but it also had a more sinister role supporting Unit 731's operations in biowarfare.  Because research found that Malaya's climate was ideal in breeding rat fleas, Malaya became Unit 731's largest breeding ground outside of Japan and China.

OKA 9420's facilities were located in the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) as well as the College of Medicine Building area along College Road.   In 2020, the political party called People's Action Party insisted on importing COVID 19 infected patients into Singapore.  The most dangerous was the global fame Delta Variant born in India and brought in by the lovers of the political party called People's Action Party.

To date, close to 1 thousand people living in Singapore died from the virus.  Thousands more in ICU, needs oxygen supply and staying in hospitals.

Do you see the similarity between Japan Imperial Army Unit 731?

Do you see how intelligent the political party called People's Action Party is?  The Party does not have to do the dirty work.",facebook.com,03-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999972622224296}",en,0.9999972622224296

The AEC performed 36,000 scopes in its 10 endoscopy suites last year. They use telepharmacy to allow medications to be dispensed by the pharmacist even while the patient is still recovering post-procedure in the centre. The team also demonstrated how they ensure endoscopes are safe for use by employing the Endoscopes Tracking System, which tracks the usage, storage and cleaning of endoscopes.

1642,"The Little Things that Matter

Every day, I reach out to my patients to see if I can help them in any ...","The Little Things that Matter

Every day, I reach out to my patients to see if I can help them in any way. It can be as simple as lending my charging cable for their mobile devices. This may seem like a small gesture, but it makes a big difference to patients when they can communicate with their loved ones. They feel more reassured and can focus on their recovery.

I remember a patient’s son who requested to bring his father out of the ward for some fresh air and sunshine. His father was too weak to be outdoors, so I found a sunny spot at a service lift lobby with a large window looking out to the garden. He spent 30 minutes there with his father, who passed on the next day. He shared that we had helped to fulfil his father’s last wish and that their time together had given him closure as a caregiver.

These moments reinforce my belief that the little things we do can make a real difference. This is also true in the area of quality improvement, where we can enhance patient outcomes markedly through small changes. The “Fall Less” project, which I co-led, aimed to reduce the number of falls in our ward by improving communication amongst the healthcare team.

We came up with the idea of creating a chat group that informed the team about patients who were at higher risk of falling.

Another idea was to have information signs placed next to patients’ beds, where nurses and physiotherapists recorded the patients’ walking ability, assistive devices they needed and dates of assessment.

With these initiatives, the number of falls in our ward fell by 61% within 12 months. This helped to reduce the length of hospital stays and prevent medical complications. The success of these initiatives has also won the SingHealth Target Zero Harm Award 2021 Best Team Award.

Gillain Jessica Liew Shue Ying fail to conform to red light signal hit pedestrian on 5apr2021
fined $4000 &disqualified from driving for 5 years

quoted

A woman who drove into an assistant registrar outside the Supreme Court, causing him to suffer a facial fracture and dislocated shoulder, was fined $4,000 on Tuesday (Feb 15).
Gillain Jessica Liew Shue Ying was also disqualified from driving for five years after pleading guilty to causing grievous hurt by driving without due care and attention.
Liew, 43, was driving along High Street at about 5.50pm on April 5 last year when she made a right turn onto North Bridge Road, where she collided with Mr Paul Tan Wei Chern, 42.

The assistant registrar with the Supreme Court was using a pedestrian crossing when the green man was blinking, which meant the signal was in his favour.
The collision left him with a facial fracture and dislocated shoulder.
He was taken to Singapore General Hospital where he was warded for five days before being discharged with 49 days of hospitalisation leave.

The court was told the injuries affected his daily living and that healing takes between three and six months.
Liew, who had a clean driving record, rendered assistance immediately after the accident, and fully cooperated with the authorities.
The prosecution said that in the light of these factors, the custodial threshold had not been crossed and asked for the maximum fine.

For her offence, Liew could have been fined up to $5,000 and jailed for up to two years.

Prof Goh was a Specialist Healthcare Volunteer with the SIF from 2004, when she pioneered and led Palliative Care projects in Vietnam and Indonesia. For over a decade, she raised awareness about the importance of a holistic palliative care approach and built capacity overseas through our train-the-trainer programmes. 

Prof Goh also connected us with many volunteers and partners, leaving behind a legacy of dedicated volunteers and ensured the sustainability of the palliative care programme. 

Prof Goh embodies the SIF's mission to make friends for a better world. She will be dearly missed.

We had the privilege to work with Professor Goh when she reached out to us in the thick of the Covid-19 pandemic to help 34-year-old Bangladeshi migrant worker Sikdar Rana fly home to see his wife, 6-year-old son and other family members one last time when he was diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer. Despite facing several hurdles along the way, Professor Goh was determined to support Sikdar through the ordeal and help him find solace when all hope was gone. To fulfil his wish, MWC started a fundraiser to cover Sikdar’s medical evacuation to Bangladesh and provide for the needs of him and his family, while approaching the Singapore Industrial and Services Employees' Union for a discount on the flight.
 
Professor Goh’s perseverance paid off. Within a few days, Sikdar managed to fly back home during circuit breaker 2020 via emergency evacuation with support from MWC through the Migrant Workers’ Assistance Fund (MWAF) and had a joyful reunion celebrating Hari Raya together with his loved ones at home. Quoting Professor Goh and her team as “angels” in a Bangladeshi newspaper article, Professor Goh said Mr Sikdar wouldn't have believed that her team could pull off his repatriation, even as he consented to his picture being taken for the fundraiser.
 
While we grieve the loss of an angel - Professor Cynthia Goh, we honour her dedication and compassion in touching the lives of countless patients in their final moments and for transforming the palliative care sector in Singapore and internationally. Our thoughts and prayers are with her loved ones in this time of sorrow, and may their hearts be filled with wonderful memories of joyful times together as we remember a life well-lived.

In the fast paced work environment of the Emergency Department, tensions can sometimes escalate quickly when patients and visitors become emotional or aggressive.

At the SGH’s Department of Emergency Medicine, our nurses have, at times, experienced verbal and physical abuse such as being yelled at with expletives and subjected to violent behaviours such as being punched, scratched, pinched and spat at by patients.

When nurses encountered such aggression, they would call the security team. However, not all security officers were confident in restraining the aggressors. They were often concerned that they would cause harm to the patients who were already injured or had other medical conditions.

Our project team, comprising DEM nurses and security staff members, came together to implement a “Code White Activation” to effectively manage aggression to minimise incidents of staff injury.

Nurses and security officers were taught techniques to restrain violent patients safely and effectively. We established the protocol, such as how the security team would respond upon activation and when to escalate situations. We also put together a quick response team, comprising nursing and security staff members, which would be swiftly activated to manage violent patients. More importantly, establishing a procedure of debriefing after each incident allows our staff to reflect and learn from their experiences.

Our nurses and security staff are now more skilled and confident in managing violent patients, and they know exactly what to do and expect when Code White is activated.

Since we introduced Code White in April 2019, there have been over 50 activations with a significant decrease in staff injury cases as well as zero patient injury cases.

Code White interventions have helped de-escalate violent situations and create a safe and positive healthcare experience for everyone. #SHQSA2022",facebook.com,22-02-2022,"{'language': 'en', 'score': 0.9999961443217006}",en,0.9999961443217006

The Ministry of Health (MOH) has advised all public and private hospitals in Singapore to cease the use of Abbott Similac Alimentum powdered infant formula (“Alimentum”), 400g tin and Similac Human Milk Fortifier (“HMF”), 0.9g sachet. This follows a recall direction that had been issued by the Singapore Food Agency to Abbott Laboratories (S) Pte Ltd (“Abbott”) for Abbott infant formula products from the United States due to possible Cronobacter sakazakii and Salmonella Newport contamination.
2. MOH has also advised all public and private hospitals to be vigilant for Cronobacter infection or Salmonellosis among infants or young children who may have consumed products affected by the recall.
3. Investigations are ongoing to determine the extent of use of the implicated products in our hospitals. To date, nine hospitals (Gleneagles Hospital, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Mount Alvernia Hospital, Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, National University Hospital, Raffles Hospital, Singapore General Hospital and Thomson Medical Centre) have confirmed the use of the implicated products. We are working with the hospitals to identify and contact parents and caregivers of patients who might have received the products, to advise them on the actions to be taken. To date, the hospitals have not reported any case of adverse events arising from the consumption of these products. MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely.
4. Parents and caregivers of infants who have purchased the implicated infant formula products from retail outlets, should also stop using the products immediately. They should seek immediate medical treatment if their infants become unwell after consuming the implicated products with symptoms including fever, crying, poor feeding, lethargy seizures (for Cronobacter infections) and diarrhoea, fever, abdominal cramps, aches, headaches, lethargy, rash and blood in urine or stools (for Salmonella infection). Both infections can be treated with antibiotics.
5. The implicated products can be identified by the lot number and expiry date indicated at the bottom of the packaging. The first two digits of the code are “22” through “37”. The code on the container also contains “K8”, “SH” or “Z2” and the expiration date is on 1 April 2022 or later.

Assistant Professor Chin-Ann Johnny Ong, Consultant in the Department of Sarcoma, Peritoneal and Rare Tumours (SPRinT), Division of Surgery and Surgical Oncology, SGH and NCCS, shared about his team’s discovery that inhibiting the protein plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in the ascites of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis may improve their outcomes. If cancer cells and the environment of the cancer are the &quot;seed&quot; and &quot;soil&quot;, respectively, this new treatment strategy focuses on the &quot;water&quot; that promotes tumour growth and seeks to limit the proliferation of cancer cells by inhibiting PAI-1 in ascites. 

This concept of targeting &quot;wat­­er&quot; is not just applicable to peritoneal carcinomatosis and can be used to understand what causes the proliferation of different cancer cells and their treatment. The research was published in this month’s Cell Reports Medicine.

Asst Prof Ong explained that current treatments for peritoneal carcinomatosis have low efficacy because disease awareness is low and treatments are not targeted enough. He and his team analysed tissue samples of 156 patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis at different stages and detected the key presence of PAI-1. Prior to the team's discovery, PAI-1 had not been linked intra-abdominal cancer growth. 

Over the next five years, the team hopes to develop treatments based on this discovery, and to evaluate their clinical efficacy. Asst Prof Ong shared that the goal of the treatment is to relieve the symptoms of peritoneal carcinomatosis patients, improve their condition and lengthen their lifespan, especially in those with aggressive cancers.

1763,国立癌症中心研究 抑制腹水蛋白质新疗法 可能提升腹膜癌患者疗效,"新加坡中央医院与国立癌症中心腹膜肿瘤与罕见肉瘤科顾问王进安助理教授带领的研究团队发现，若能抑制病患腹腔内腹水中一种名为纤溶酶原活化物抑制因子-1（PAI-1）的关键蛋白质，有望提高病患的治疗效果。

新加坡国立癌症中心研究员发现可能治疗腹膜癌的新方式。若把癌细胞和肿瘤所在的表面分别视为“种子”和“土壤”，新疗法聚焦在助长肿瘤生长的“水”，通过抑制腹水中一种特定蛋白质来遏制癌细胞增殖，希望提升腹膜癌患者的治疗效果和生存率。

2019年底，杨惠卿（67岁，教堂唱诗班指挥）和孙子玩耍时，突然感到下腹右边一阵剧痛。她原以为是暂时性的肌肉疼痛，但疼痛持续一周，随后还发烧，吃退烧药仍不退。

全科医生确认杨惠卿没有患上骨痛热症，建议她到医院急诊室。住院两周后，杨惠卿在2019年12月被诊断患上第四期盲肠癌，部分癌细胞已扩散到腹膜。

杨惠卿说：“我和孩子们当时非常震惊。我从未听过盲肠癌，甚至在确诊前没有感觉身体有任何不适，怎么就发展到第四期罕见癌症了？”

每年约千名腹膜癌病患
仅5％至10％可治愈

非常幸运的是，杨惠卿可接受手术消灭癌肿瘤，术后也无须辅助性化疗。她在隔年2月完成约10小时的手术，住院17天，如今康复良好，只须定期复诊。

腹膜是衬于腹腔和盆腔表面的一层薄膜，覆盖绝大部分腹部器官，而腹膜癌可能源自腹膜本身，或因其他器官的原发性癌症扩散而导致。其中，胃、大肠和卵巢癌引发腹膜肿瘤的概率尤其高，约六七成的卵巢癌病患也会出现腹膜癌。

国立癌症中心每年约1000名腹膜癌病患，当中仅5％到10％病患如杨惠卿，有可能通过细胞减灭术（CRS）和腹腔热灌注化疗（HIPEC）治愈；约三成病患可进行全身性化疗，但抗癌药物较难渗入腹腔对抗癌细胞，以致疗效低，而其余约六七成只能接受慈怀疗护来应付症状，意即无法治愈。

新加坡中央医院与国立癌症中心腹膜肿瘤与罕见肉瘤科顾问王进安助理教授解释：“腹膜癌病患的治疗效果低，主要是因为公众包括医疗人员，对腹膜癌可治疗的意识仍不足够，疗法也属初级。”

由王进安带领的研究团队以两三年的时间针对156名处在不同阶段的腹膜癌病患的生物样本进行分析，发现病患腹腔内所累积的腹水中，有一种名为纤溶酶原活化物抑制因子-1（PAI-1）的关键蛋白质。

若能抑制这个关键蛋白质，就能遏制癌细胞增殖，有望提高病患的治疗效果。在研究团队发现PAI-1之前，尚未有人发现PAI-1与腹腔内癌的生长有关。

下来五年，团队希望能研发治疗方法和药物，并且对药物的临床疗效进行评估。其设想的疗法包括把药物直接注入与身体其他部位分离且封闭的腹腔中，以直接抑制腹水中的PAI-1，从而获得最佳疗效。

王进安助理教授：
目标是让病患寿命延长两倍

王进安解释，腹膜癌病患一般上应该能接受这项疗法，包括末期癌症病患，也可通过这类方式缓解症状，改善病情。“我们的目标是把病患寿命延长两倍，尤其针对患有侵略性非常高的癌症病患。”

王进安也强调，研究不只发现针对腹膜癌的新疗法，这种针对“水”的疗法概念，旨在找出是什么促进不同癌细胞增殖，也可改变其他癌症未来的治疗方式。

Even with her seniority, she insists on being called Sister. This is in line with her demeanour—approachable and soft-spoken with an air of calm.

Her duties in recent years have become administrative and supervisory in nature but she continues with her work on the ground out of passion for nursing. On the day of the interview for this profile, she was at the Ambulatory Surgery Centre until 12 o’clock and from there she went to Outram Community Hospital.

All the best, Mr Baey and speedy recovery. 
Today is my 24th session. It’s a milestone as I can now begin my single-digit countdown to the completion of my radiation treatment on 26 Jan. 

Many thanks to Sin and her team of radiation therapists at SGH. Even though each session lasts just seven minutes and does not cause any pain or discomfort, the daily routine and side effects can take a toll on any patient. 

Sin has been very patient since the beginning, guiding me through the procedure, preparing me for the side effects, and most importantly encouraging me to persevere. 

Sometimes, when I had to adjust the timing, she would accommodate my requests. 

It’s a blessing to all patients to have such dedicated healthcare workers be there with us.

In the Southeast Asian region, the use of P. aeruginosa in molecular epidemiological surveys remains limited for tracking antimicrobial resistance

Researchers from the Singapore General Hospital, National University of Singapore and National University Health System - NUHS sequenced the whole genomes of 222 carbapenem-non-susceptible P. aeruginosa (CNPA) isolates collected in 2006 - 2020 to determine clonal relatedness, multi-locus sequence types, and antimicrobial resistance determinants (acquired and chromosomal).

Their results provide a “snapshot” of the circulating lineages of CNPA locally and the prevailing genetic mechanisms contributing to carbapenem resistance. Additionally, this database serves as the baseline for future prospective surveillance studies.

I launched the SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute of Medical Simulation (SIMS) i3 Hub yesterday. i3 stands for “inspire, innovate, incubate”. 
 
This is a “Disneyland” for training of healthcare professionals – a simulation training space with Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies in serious games.
 
One of these games is the Acute Care game, developed by the Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Internal Medicine. It uses VR to simulate the management of septic shock, a highly time-sensitive condition, putting the trainee through the pressures of information processing and decision making in a safe environment. 
 
I also tried my hand at the Basic Cardiac Life Support game, which will be extremely helpful for many healthcare professionals who are looking to get their Basic Cardiac Life Support certification, including myself!
 
Serious games are gaining fresh relevance with the new generation of learners who are more  tech savvy. Excited to see how SIMS i3 hub can blaze the trail in healthcare simulation, and transform healthcare education.

Somewhere on SGH Campus lies a room filled with cutting-edge #virtualreality technology and gaming equipment. Are our doctors getting ready for the #metaverse? Maybe! 

In this space, SingHealth educators develop and use #seriousgames to transform healthcare simulation for tomorrow’s care, hone skills through repeated play, and enhance teamwork with multi-player games.

Yesterday, we launched the SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute of Medical Simulation (SIMS) i3 Hub, a dedicated space fully equipped with a wide array of Extended Reality (XR) solutions and the latest gaming equipment. Find out more about the space in this Channel NewsAsia report.

Earlier this morning (19 Jan) at about 6.10am, SCDF was alerted to a fire at the aforementioned location.

Upon SCDF’s arrival, the fire could be seen inside a unit on the 3rd floor. The fire involved the contents of a living room and was extinguished with one Compressed Air Foam (CAF) Backpack.

Six occupants had evacuated from the unit prior to SCDF’s arrival. SCDF conveyed five occupants to Singapore General Hospital for smoke inhalation.

About 45 people from neighbouring units self-evacuated before SCDF's arrival. 

Preliminary investigation indicates that the fire had originated from the battery pack of a Power Assisted Bicycle. The battery was being charged at the time of the fire.

SCDF would like to remind the public on the prevention of PMD/PAB fires, including not to charge batteries for an extended period of time or overnight. Do not buy or use non-original batteries. See the accompanying infographic for more fire safety tips.

这起事件发生在今早（1月19日）6时许，地点是位于裕廊西5道第723座组屋。

送餐员哈西卜（27岁）告诉《联合早报》，单位住着一家六口，包括他的九旬高龄阿嫲、父母亲，妹妹及女佣。

“一大早母亲和女佣就起床为家人准备早餐，忽然发现客厅的一角烧起来，她们赶忙敲门叫醒我。”

哈西卜表示，当他打开门时，客厅已经浓烟滚滚，他于是赶忙报警，一家人疏散到走廊时，除他之外的其余五人全因吸入浓烟感到不适而送院。

民防部队受询时证实，当局在今早6时10分接到火患通报。民防人员抵达现场后，发现三楼一个单位起火，火势涉及到客厅内的物品，当局人员用压缩空气泡沫背包灭火。

单位内六名住户在民防人员抵达前已自行疏散，其中五人因吸入浓烟被送往新加坡中央医院。另有45名居民受影响在民防人员抵达前自行疏散。

初步调查显示，火患是从一辆电动脚踏车的电池烧起的，电动脚踏车事发时还在充电。

民防部队提醒，公众应注意防范类似火患，不要给电动脚踏车或电动踏板车充电过久或者充过夜，也不要购买或使用非原装电池。

Her request for bail was denied and she is to be remanded upon her discharge from Singapore General Hospital (SGH).

Koh was admitted to SGH after being warded in the Institute of Mental Health.

Her lawyer, Mr Clarence Lun from Fervent Chambers, confirmed that Koh was in hospital but could not say since when or why she was hospitalised.

According to court documents, between July 2021 and January 2022, Koh was party to a criminal conspiracy with Quah to dishonestly make false representations to MOH that people were vaccinated with the Sinopharm vaccine, when they were not.

This was so that they could obtain certificates of vaccination against Covid-19 for these people.

At about 4.40am today (29 Jan), SCDF was alerted to a fire at the above-mentioned location.

Upon SCDF’s arrival, the fire was raging and had totally engulfed a unit on the 10th floor.

Firefighters donned breathing apparatus sets and proceeded cautiously into the smoke-logged unit. The fire, which involved contents of the entire unit, was extinguished with two water jets.

As the firefighting operation was on-going, an evacuation of residents from neighbouring units was conducted. Firefighters conducted forcible entry into the unit directly above the fire and found a woman lying unconscious on the floor. The crew immediately rescued the woman out of the unit and brought her to the lift lobby. There, an ambulance crew, together with the firefighters, conducted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the woman. She was subsequently conveyed to Singapore General Hospital (SGH). 

About 280 people were evacuated as a precautionary measure. Another person was assessed by an ambulance crew and was conveyed to SGH for smoke inhalation injuries.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.

Firefighters donned breathing apparatus sets and proceeded cautiously into the smoke-logged unit. The fire, which involved contents of the entire unit, was extinguished with two water jets.

As the firefighting operation was on-going, an evacuation of residents from neighbouring units was conducted. Firefighters conducted forcible entry into the unit directly above the fire and found a woman lying unconscious on the floor. The crew immediately rescued the woman out of the unit and brought her to the lift lobby. There, an ambulance crew, together with the firefighters, conducted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the woman. She was subsequently conveyed to Singapore General Hospital (SGH). 

About 280 people were evacuated as a precautionary measure. Another person was assessed by an ambulance crew and was conveyed to SGH for smoke inhalation injuries.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.

2033,印尼籍女佣在直落布兰雅组屋火患中丧命 - 8world,"一名印度尼西亚籍女佣在昨天凌晨于直落布兰雅一个组屋单位发生的火患中丧命。据这名女佣的邻居透露，死者于昨晚离世，遗体将在明天领出后送回家乡。

《8视界新闻网》早前报道，直落布兰雅坡第39座组屋十楼一个单位昨天（29日）凌晨4点40分左右失火。

根据新加坡民防部队发布的帖文，当局在疏散附近单位约280个居民时，发现一名女子倒卧在事发单位楼上的单位内，随后将她送往新加坡中央医院。

邻居证实女佣已经离世

邻居何先生今天（30日）向《8视界新闻网》证实，送院的女子是名为Emma的印尼籍女佣，她已在昨晚离世。

“Emma是我们一家人的朋友。我们以前住在同一栋组屋，通过她的雇主认识她。”

被委办理身后事

何先生透露，他目前搬到了事发单位附近组屋，昨天凌晨接获父母亲的来电后赶往现场，发现救护人员正使用担架把Emma送上救护车。

他表示，事发时Emma独自一人在失火单位楼上的单位内，与她同住的雇主、儿子及另一名租户目前人在国外，因此都不在家。有鉴于此，雇主也将Emma的身后事委托由他办理。

何先生说，Emma的遗体会在明天（31日）被领出，隔天（2月1日）就会安排送回国。由于案件还在调查中，他不方便透露太多其他细节。

网上筹丧葬费与遗体遣送费

为了筹集Emma的丧葬费与遗体遣送费，何先生代表死者的亲友与家属通过GoGetFunding网站发起众筹，目标设定为3万元。

何先生还强调，扣除丧礼费所筹得的款项将全数交给她的家人。

截至截稿，共有103名善心人士捐出超过4000多元，加上线下筹得的1000多元，目前共筹得5100多元。

虽然目前他设定捐款的截止期限为一个月，但他透露可能在近日就会停止捐款，并将款项一并交给Emma的家人，好让他们应付开销。

何先生表示，自2019冠状病毒疫情暴发以来，Emma就一直无法回国。而在家乡印尼三宝垄，她还有一名17岁女儿及年迈的父母需要照料。

法官今天表示，被告多次阻碍调查，包括撕毁控状和口供书，在很大程度上构成她被继续拘留的理由。控方也指被告出现“显示她决心不跟警方合作的一系列行为”，因此反对她的申请。

卓欣成回想起往年与家人在除夕团聚吃饭，儿女都会特地打包全家人爱吃的食物，包括卤鸭、虾枣以及鲍鱼等。

“但我最享受的不是食物，而是家人之间交换礼物。因健康问题，我吃得不多，但一家人团聚既是传统，妻子、儿女、女婿以及两名年幼孙子有说有笑，彼此送衣服等小礼物，我看了也很开心。”

疫情前当旅游巴士司机的卓欣成因晚期肝病引发并发症，本月25日入院，目前正等待转院并接受进一步治疗，以及计划肝脏移植手术。

卓欣成受访时透露，家人对他再次住院表示担忧，加上本地医院和住院护理设施从上周起暂时禁止访客，以致家人不能前去医院探访，但儿女每天都会与他通电话，两名九岁和10岁的孙子也会与他视讯，带给他温暖。

配合除夕，陈笃生医院今天为所有住院病患特别准备过年餐，包括饺子汤、彩椒龙凤球、滑子菇扒时蔬、蛋炒饭、柑橘，以及椰香紫米糊，各个菜肴含有新年寓意。

卓欣成说：“我非常感激医院即使忙于应对疫情，却还不忘让我们这些病患感染佳节气氛，但我也觉得有点不好意思。”

“One thing I enjoy most about my nursing course at @nanyangpoly is the clinical postings that we go for. I get to put the skills that I have learnt into practice, and it allows me to gain first-hand experience in caring for patients!

I found out about the Integrated Nursing Scholarship (INS) through an open house at Singapore General Hospital. The scholarship officer who reached out to me was really patient and took the time to answer all my questions. I also attended a scholarship talk and spoke to Farah, a fellow INS scholar. She shared with me how it has provided her with many opportunities to grow as a leader and network with other healthcare students.”

2209,医院加强跨部门合作 更多晚期肾衰竭病人选择腹膜透析 - 8world,"过去十年来，只有约20%的晚期肾衰竭病人选择在家洗肾。但有医院发现自从加强跨部门合作和后续护理协调后，选择腹膜透析的病患去年上升至35%。

面对血液透析和腹膜透析这两个方案，黄国雄果断地选择了后者，去年2月开始在家自行洗肾。

黄国雄说：“血液透析是需要一个星期去三次，然后每次大概四个小时就比较耗时。然后有比较严格的控水，一天就不能喝超过一公升。这个呢就对生活的影响相对减到较低。”

医生为病人插管两个星期后，就会为他们展开三到五天的培训，并且通过家访，观察他们是否正确地在家自行做腹膜透析。如有需要他们也可以拨打专属热线询问护士。

邱德拔医院在新加坡医学专科学院医学专刊《Annals》发表的研究提到，培训专科医生包括介入肾脏病学科和泌尿科医生进行腹透前的导管手术，减少了病人的等候时间。安排人员协调和跟进复查情况，也有助鼓励肾衰竭病人在家洗肾。

邱德拔医院肾脏科高级顾问医生廖忻麟说：“在开发合作模式前，我们必须将病人转介到其他部门，可能得等上四到六周。展开跨部门合作后，我们就能加速，一周内为病人进行导管手术。”

新加坡肾脏病学会成员兼新加坡中央医院肾科高级顾问医生胡慧英说：“进行腹透的人并不多是因为最主要有三个因素。第一是他们缺乏对腹透的了解，第二是缺乏信心自己操作这个治疗，第三就是担心腹膜炎或者导管出口处感染。但是这个感染的几率并不高，60个患者里面做腹透一个月，只有一个人会得到。”

新加坡肾脏病学会认为应加强宣导排除疑虑，这有助提高腹透在本地的普及率。 ...",8world.com,08-01-2022,"{'language': 'zh-cn', 'score': 0.9999988957566218}",zh-cn,0.9999988957566218
